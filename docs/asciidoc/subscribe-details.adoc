=== `subscribe` Method Examples

This section contains minimal examples of each of the five signatures for the `subscribe`
method. The following code shows an example of the basic method with no arguments:

[source,java]
----
Flux<Integer> ints = Flux.range(1, 3); <1>
ints.subscribe(); <2>
----

<1> Set up a `Flux` that produces three values when a subscriber attaches.
<2> Subscribe in the simplest way.

The preceding code produces no visible output, but it does work. The `Flux` produces
three values. If we provide a lambda, we can make the values visible. The next example
for the `subscribe` method shows one way to make the values appear:

[source,java]
----
Flux<Integer> ints = Flux.range(1, 3); <1>
ints.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i)); <2>
----

<1> Set up a `Flux` that produces three values when a subscriber attaches.
<2> Subscribe with a subscriber that will print the values.

The preceding code produces the following output:

----
1
2
3
----

To demonstrate the next signature, we intentionally introduce an error, as
shown in the following example:

[source, java]
----
Flux<Integer> ints = Flux.range(1, 4) <1>
      .map(i -> { <2>
        if (i <= 3) return i; <3>
        throw new RuntimeException("Got to 4"); <4>
      });
ints.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i), <5>
      error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error));
----

<1> Set up a Flux that produces four values when a subscriber attaches.
<2> We need a map so that we can handle some values differently.
<3> For most values, return the value.
<4> For one value, force an error.
<5> Subscribe with a subscriber that includes an error handler.

We now have two lambda expressions: one for the content we expect and one for
errors. The preceding code produces the following output:

----
1
2
3
Error: java.lang.RuntimeException: Got to 4
----

The next signature of the `subscribe` method includes both an error handler and
a handler for completion events, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
Flux<Integer> ints = Flux.range(1, 4); <1>
ints.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i),
    error -> System.err.println("Error " + error),
    () -> System.out.println("Done")); <2>
----

<1> Set up a Flux that produces four values when a Subscriber attaches.
<2> Subscribe with a Subscriber that includes a handler for completion events.

Error signals and completion signals are both terminal events and are exclusive of one
another (you never get both). To make the completion consumer work, we must take care not
to trigger an error.

The completion callback has no input, as represented by an empty pair of
parentheses: it matches the `run` method in the `Runnable` interface. The preceding code
produces the following output:

----
1
2
3
4
Done
----

The last signature of the `subscribe` method includes a `Consumer<Subscription>`.
That variant requires you to do something with the `Subscription` (perform a
`request(long)` on it, or `cancel()` it), otherwise the `Flux` will just hang:

[source,java]
----
Flux<Integer> ints = Flux.range(1, 4);
ints.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i),
    error -> System.err.println("Error " + error),
    () -> System.out.println("Done"),
    sub -> sub.request(10)); <1>
----
<1> When we subscribe we receive a `Subscription`. Signal that we want up to `10`
elements from the source (which will actually emit 4 elements and complete).


=== Cancelling a `subscribe()` with its `Disposable`

All these lambda-based variants of `subscribe()` have a `Disposable` return type.
In this case, the `Disposable` interface represents the fact that the subscription
can be _cancelled_, by calling its `dispose()` method.

For a `Flux` or `Mono`, cancellation is a signal that the source should stop
producing elements. However, it is NOT guaranteed to be immediate: some sources
might produce elements so fast that they could complete even before receiving the
cancel instruction.

Some utilities around `Disposable` are available in the `Disposables` class.
Among these, `Disposables.swap()` creates a `Disposable` wrapper that allows
you to atomically cancel and replace a concrete `Disposable`. This can be useful,
for instance, in a UI scenario where you want to cancel a request and replace it
with a new one whenever the user clicks on a button. Disposing the wrapper itself
closes it, disposing the current concrete value and all future attempted replacements.

Another interesting utility is `Disposables.composite(...)`. This composite
allows to collect several `Disposable`, for instance multiple in-flight request
associated with a service call, and dispose all of them at once later on.
Once the composite's `dispose()` method has been called, any attempt at adding
another `Disposable` immediately disposes it.


=== Alternative to lambdas: `BaseSubscriber`

There is an additional `subscribe` method that is more generic and takes a full-blown
`Subscriber` rather than composing one out of lambdas. In order to help you writing
such a `Subscriber`, we provide an extendable class called `BaseSubscriber`.

WARNING: Instances of `BaseSubscriber` (or subclasses of it) are **single-use**,
meaning that a `BaseSubscriber` will cancel its subscription to the first `Publisher` if it
is subscribed to a second `Publisher`.
That is because using an instance twice would violate the Reactive Streams rule that a
`Subscriber`'s `onNext` method must not be called in parallel.
As a result, anonymous implementations are fine only if they're declared directly within
the call to `Publisher#subscribe(Subscriber)`.

Let's implement one of these, we'll call it a `SampleSubscriber`. The following
example shows how it would be attached to a `Flux`:

[source,java]
----
SampleSubscriber<Integer> ss = new SampleSubscriber<Integer>();
Flux<Integer> ints = Flux.range(1, 4);
ints.subscribe(i -> System.out.println(i),
    error -> System.err.println("Error " + error),
    () -> {System.out.println("Done");},
    s -> s.request(10));
ints.subscribe(ss);
----

Now let's have a look at what `SampleSubscriber` could look like, as a minimalistic
implementation of a `BaseSubscriber`:

[source,java]
----
package io.projectreactor.samples;

import org.reactivestreams.Subscription;

import reactor.core.publisher.BaseSubscriber;

public class SampleSubscriber<T> extends BaseSubscriber<T> {

	public void hookOnSubscribe(Subscription subscription) {
		System.out.println("Subscribed");
		request(1);
	}

	public void hookOnNext(T value) {
		System.out.println(value);
		request(1);
	}
}
----

The SampleSubscriber class extends `BaseSubscriber`, which is the recommended abstract
class for user-defined `Subscribers` in Reactor. The class offers hooks that can be
overridden to tune the subscriber's behavior. By default, it will trigger an unbounded
request and behave exactly like `subscribe()`. However, extending `BaseSubscriber` is
much more useful when you want a custom request amount.

For custom request amount, the bare minimum is to implement `hookOnSubscribe(Subscription subscription)`
and `hookOnNext(T value)` like we did. In our case, the `hookOnSubscribe` method
prints a statement to standard out and makes the first request. Then the `hookOnNext`
method prints a statement and performs additional requests, one request
at a time.

The `SampleSubscriber` class produces the following output:

----
Subscribed
1
2
3
4
----

`BaseSubscriber` also offers a `requestUnbounded()` method to switch to unbounded mode
(equivalent to `request(Long.MAX_VALUE)`), as well as a `cancel()` method.

It has additional hooks: `hookOnComplete`, `hookOnError`, `hookOnCancel`, and `hookFinally`
(which is always called when the sequence terminates, with the type of termination passed
in as a `SignalType` parameter)

NOTE: You almost certainly want to implement the `hookOnError`, `hookOnCancel`, and
`hookOnComplete` methods. You may also want to implement the `hookFinally` method.
`SampleSubscribe` is the absolute minimum implementation of a `Subscriber` _that performs
bounded requests_.

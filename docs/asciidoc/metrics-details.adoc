### Meters and tags for Reactor-Core-Micrometer module

[[micrometer-details-metrics]]
#### `Micrometer.metrics()`
Below is the list of meters used by the metrics tap listener feature, as exposed via
`Micrometer.metrics(MeterRegistry meterRegistry)`.

IMPORTANT: Please note that metrics below use a dynamic `%s` prefix.
When applied on a `Flux` or `Mono` that uses the `name(String n)` operator, this is replaced with `n`.
Otherwise, this is replaced by the default value of `"reactor"`.

[[micrometer-details-timedScheduler]]
#### `Micrometer.timedScheduler()`
Below is the list of meters used by the TimedScheduler feature, as exposed via
`Micrometer.timedScheduler(Scheduler original, MeterRegistry meterRegistry, String metricsPrefix)`.

IMPORTANT: Please note that metrics below use a dynamic `%s` prefix. This is replaced with the provided `metricsPrefix` in practice.

[[micrometer-details-observation]]
#### `Micrometer.observation()`
Below is the list of meters used by the observation tap listener feature, as exposed via
`Micrometer.observation(ObservationRegistry registry)`.

This is the ANONYMOUS observation, but you can create a similar Observation with a custom name by using the `name(String)` operator.

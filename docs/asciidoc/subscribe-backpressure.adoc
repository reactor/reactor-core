=== On Backpressure and Ways to Reshape Requests

When implementing backpressure in Reactor, the way consumer pressure is propagated back to the source is by sending a `request` to the upstream operator.
The sum of current requests is sometimes referenced to as the current "`demand`", or "`pending request`".
Demand is capped at `Long.MAX_VALUE`, representing an unbounded request (meaning "`produce as fast as you can`" -- basically disabling backpressure).

The first request comes from the final subscriber at subscription time, yet the most direct ways of subscribing all immediately trigger an unbounded request of `Long.MAX_VALUE`:

* `subscribe()` and most of its lambda-based variants (to the exception of the one that has a `Consumer<Subscription>`)
* `block()`, `blockFirst()` and `blockLast()`
* iterating over a `toIterable()` or `toStream()`

The simplest way of customizing the original request is to `subscribe` with a `BaseSubscriber` with the `hookOnSubscribe` method overridden, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux.range(1, 10)
    .doOnRequest(r -> System.out.println("request of " + r))
    .subscribe(new BaseSubscriber<Integer>() {

      @Override
      public void hookOnSubscribe(Subscription subscription) {
        request(1);
      }

      @Override
      public void hookOnNext(Integer integer) {
        System.out.println("Cancelling after having received " + integer);
        cancel();
      }
    });
----
====

The preceding snippet prints out the following:

====
[source]
----
request of 1
Cancelling after having received 1
----
====

WARNING: When manipulating a request, you must be careful to produce enough demand for
the sequence to advance, or your Flux can get "`stuck`". That is why `BaseSubscriber`
defaults to an unbounded request in `hookOnSubscribe`. When overriding this hook, you should usually
call `request` at least once.

==== Operators that Change the Demand from Downstream

One thing to keep in mind is that demand expressed at the subscribe level *can* be reshaped by each operator in the upstream chain.
A textbook case is the `buffer(N)` operator: If it receives a `request(2)`, it is interpreted as a demand for *two full buffers*.
As a consequence, since buffers need `N` elements to be considered full, the `buffer` operator reshapes the request to `2 x N`.

You might also have noticed that some operators have variants that take an `int` input parameter called `prefetch`.
This is another category of operators that modify the downstream request.
These are usually operators that deal with inner sequences, deriving a `Publisher` from each incoming element (like `flatMap`).

*Prefetch* is a way to tune the initial request made on these inner sequences.
If unspecified, most of these operators start with a demand of `32`.

These operators usually also implement a *replenishing optimization*: Once the operator has seen 75% of the prefetch request fulfilled, it re-requests 75% from upstream.
This is a heuristic optimization made so that these operators proactively anticipate the upcoming requests.

Finally, a couple of operators let you directly tune the request: `limitRate` and `limitRequest`.

`limitRate(N)` splits the downstream requests so that they are propagated upstream in smaller batches.
For instance, a request of `100` made to `limitRate(10)` would result in, at most, `10` requests of `10` being propagated to the upstream.
Note that, in this form, `limitRate` actually implements the replenishing optimization discussed earlier.

The operator has a variant that also lets you tune the replenishing amount (referred to as the `lowTide` in the variant): `limitRate(highTide, lowTide)`.
Choosing a `lowTide` of `0` results in *strict* batches of `highTide` requests, instead of batches further reworked by the replenishing strategy.

`limitRequest(N)`, on the other hand, *caps* the downstream request to a maximum total demand.
It adds up requests up to `N`. If a single `request` does not make the total demand overflow over `N`, that particular request is wholly propagated upstream.
After that amount has been emitted by the source, `limitRequest` considers the sequence complete, sends an `onComplete` signal downstream, and cancels the source.

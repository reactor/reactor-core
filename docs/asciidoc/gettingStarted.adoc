[[getting-started-introducing-reactor]]
== Introducing Reactor
//TODO flesh out, reword. could also be updated on the website
Reactor is a fully non-blocking reactive programming foundation for the JVM, with
efficient demand management (in the form of managing "backpressure"). It integrates
directly with the Java 8 functional APIs, notably `CompletableFuture`, `Stream`, and
`Duration`. It offers composable asynchronous sequence APIs `Flux` (for [N] elements) and
`Mono` (for [0|1] elements), extensively implementing the [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org/)
specification.

Reactor also supports non-blocking inter-process communication with the
`reactor-netty` project. Suited for Microservices Architecture, Reactor Netty offers
backpressure-ready network engines for HTTP (including Websockets), TCP, and UDP.
Reactive Encoding and Decoding are fully supported.

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites
Reactor Core runs on `Java 8` and above.

It has a transitive dependency on `org.reactivestreams:reactive-streams:1.0.2`.

[NOTE]
====
*Android support*:

* Reactor 3 does not officially support or target Android (consider using RxJava 2 if
such support is a strong requirement).
* However, it should work fine with Android SDK 26 (Android O) and above.
* We are open to evaluating changes that benefit Android support in a best-effort
fashion. However, we cannot make guarantees. Each decision must be made on a
case-by-case basis.

[[getting-started-understanding-bom]]
== Understanding the BOM
Reactor 3 uses a BOM model since `reactor-core 3.0.4`, with the `Aluminium` release train.
This curated list groups artifacts that are meant to work well together, providing
the relevant versions despite potentially divergent versioning schemes in these artifacts.

The BOM (Bill of Materials) is itself versioned, using a release train scheme
with a codename followed by a qualifier. Here are a few examples:
[verse]
Aluminium-RELEASE
Californium-BUILD-SNAPSHOT
Aluminium-SR1
Bismuth-RELEASE
Californium-SR32

The codenames represent what would traditionally be the MAJOR.MINOR number. They (mostly)
come from the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table#Overview[Periodic Table of
Elements], in increasing alphabetical order.

The qualifiers are (in chronological order):

* `BUILD-SNAPSHOT`
* `M1`..`N`: Milestones or developer previews
* `RELEASE`: The first GA (General Availability) release in a codename series
* `SR1`..`N`: The subsequent GA releases in a codename series (equivalent to PATCH
number, SR stands for "Service Release").

== Getting Reactor
As mentioned earlier, the easiest way to use Reactor in your core is to use the BOM and
add the relevant dependencies to your project. Note that, when adding such a dependency,
you must omit the version so that the version gets picked up from the BOM.

However, if you want to force the use of a specific artifact's version, you can specify
it when adding your dependency, as you usually would. You can also forgo the BOM entirely
and specify dependencies by their artifact versions.

=== Maven Installation
The BOM concept is natively supported by Maven. First, you need to import the BOM by
adding the following snippet to your `pom.xml`. If the top section
(`dependencyManagement`) already exists in your pom, add only the contents.

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement> <1>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
            <artifactId>reactor-bom</artifactId>
            <version>Bismuth-RELEASE</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----
<1> Notice the `dependencyManagement` tag. This is in addition to the regular
`dependencies` section.

Next, add your dependencies to the relevant reactor projects, as usual, except without a
`<version>`, as shown here:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
        <artifactId>reactor-core</artifactId> <1>
        <2>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
        <artifactId>reactor-test</artifactId> <3>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----
<1> Dependency on the core library
<2> No version tag here
<3> `reactor-test` provides facilities to unit test reactive streams

=== Gradle installation
Gradle has no core support for Maven BOMs, but you can use Spring's
https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin[gradle-dependency-management]
plugin.

First, apply the plugin from the Gradle Plugin Portal:

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id "io.spring.dependency-management" version "1.0.6.RELEASE" <1>
}
----
<1> as of this writing, 1.0.6.RELEASE is the latest version of the plugin.
Check for updates.

Then use it to import the BOM:
[source,groovy]
----
dependencyManagement {
     imports {
          mavenBom "io.projectreactor:reactor-bom:Bismuth-RELEASE"
     }
}
----

Finally add a dependency to your project, without a version number:
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
     compile 'io.projectreactor:reactor-core' <1>
}
----
<1> There is no third `:` separated section for the version. It is taken from
the BOM.

=== Milestones and Snapshots
Milestones and developer previews are distributed through the Spring Milestones
repository rather than Maven Central. To add it to your build configuration
file, use the following snippet:

.Milestones in Maven
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>spring-milestones</id>
		<name>Spring Milestones Repository</name>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----

For Gradle, use the following snippet:

.Milestones in Gradle
[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
  maven { url 'http://repo.spring.io/milestone' }
  mavenCentral()
}
----

Similarly, snapshots are also available in a separate dedicated repository:

.BUILD-SNAPSHOTs in Maven
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>spring-snapshots</id>
		<name>Spring Snapshot Repository</name>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----

.BUILD-SNAPSHOTs in Gradle
[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
  maven { url 'http://repo.spring.io/snapshot' }
  mavenCentral()
}
----

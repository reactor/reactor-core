[[reactor-extra]]
= Reactor-Extra

The `reactor-extra` artifact contains additional operators and utilities that are for
users of `reactor-core` with advanced needs, or incubating operators.

As this is a separate artifact, you need to explicitly add it to your build. The following
example shows how to do so in Gradle:

====
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
     compile 'io.projectreactor:reactor-core'
     compile 'io.projectreactor.addons:reactor-extra' <1>
}
----
<1> Add the reactor extra artifact in addition to core. See <<getting>> for details
about why you do not need to specify a version if you use the BOM, usage in Maven, and other details.

[[extra-tuples]]
== `TupleUtils` and Functional Interfaces

The `reactor.function` package contains functional interfaces that complement the Java 8
`Function`, `Predicate`, and `Consumer` interfaces, for three to eight values.

`TupleUtils` offers static methods that act as a bridge between lambdas of these functional
interfaces to a similar interface on the corresponding `Tuple`.

This lets you easily work with independent parts of any `Tuple`, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
.map(tuple -> {
  String firstName = tuple.getT1();
  String lastName = tuple.getT2();
  String address = tuple.getT3();

  return new Customer(firstName, lastName, address);
});
----
====

You can rewrite the preceding example as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
.map(TupleUtils.function(Customer::new)); // <1>
----
<1> (as `Customer` constructor conforms to `Function3` functional interface signature)
====

[[extra-math]]
== Math Operators With `MathFlux`

The `reactor.math` package contains a `MathFlux` specialized version of `Flux` that offers
mathematical operators, including `max`, `min`, `sumInt`, `averageDouble`, and others.

[[extra-schedulers]]
== Schedulers

Reactor-extra comes with the `ForkJoinPoolScheduler` (in the `reactor.scheduler.forkjoin` package): it uses the Java `ForkJoinPool` to execute tasks.

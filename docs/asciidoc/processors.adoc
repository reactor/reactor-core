Processors are a special kind of `Publisher` that are also a `Subscriber`. That means
that you can `subscribe` to a `Processor` (generally, they implement `Flux`), but you can
also call methods to manually inject data into the sequence or terminate it.

There are several kinds of Processors, each with a few particular semantics, but before
you start looking into these, you need to ask yourself the following question:

= Do I Need a Processor?
Most of the time, you should try to avoid using a `Processor`. They are harder to use
correctly and prone to some corner cases.

If you think a `Processor` could be a good match for your use case, ask yourself if you
have tried these two alternatives:

. Could an operator or combination of operators fit the bill? (See <<which-operator>>)
. Could a <<producing,"generator">> operator work instead? (Generally, these operators
are made to bridge APIs that are not reactive, providing a "sink" that is similar in
concept to a `Processor` in the sense that it lets you manually populate the sequence
with data or terminate it).

If, after exploring the above alternatives, you still think you need a `Processor`, read
the <<processor-overview>> section below to learn about the different implementations.

= Safely Produce from Multiple Threads by Using the `Sink` Facade
Rather than directly using Reactor `Processors`, it is a good practice to obtain a `Sink`
for the `Processor` by calling `sink()` **once**.

`FluxProcessor` sinks safely gate multi-threaded producers and can be used by
applications that generate data from multiple threads concurrently. For example, a
thread-safe serialized sink can be created for `UnicastProcessor`:

[source,java]
----
UnicastProcessor<Integer> processor = UnicastProcessor.create();
FluxSink<Integer> sink = processor.sink(overflowStrategy);
----

Multiple producer threads may concurrently generate data on the following serialized
sink:

[source,java]
----
sink.next(n);
----

WARNING: Despite the `FluxSink` being adapted for multi-threaded **manual** feeding
of the `Processor`, it is not possible to mix the subscriber approach with the
sink approach: **you have to _either_ subscribe your `FluxProcessor` to a source
`Publisher` _or_ feed it manually though its `FluxSink`**.

Overflow from `next` behaves in two possible ways, depending on the `Processor` and its
configuration:

* An unbounded processor handles the overflow itself by dropping or buffering.
* A bounded processor blocks or "spins" on the `IGNORE` strategy or applies the
`overflowStrategy` behavior specified for the `sink`.

= Overview of Available Processors
Reactor Core comes with several flavors of `Processor`. Not all processors have the same
semantics but are roughly split into three categories. The following list briefly
describes the three kinds of processors:

* *direct* (`DirectProcessor` and `UnicastProcessor`): These processors can only push
data through direct user action (calling their `Sink`'s methods directly).
* *synchronous* (`EmitterProcessor` and `ReplayProcessor`): These processors can either push data
through user interaction or by subscribing to an upstream `Publisher` and synchronously
draining it.
* *asynchronous* (`WorkQueueProcessor` and `TopicProcessor`): These processors can either push
data obtained from multiple upstream `Publishers` or through user interaction.
They are more robust and are  backed by a `RingBuffer` data structure in order
to deal with their multiple upstreams.

The asynchronous processors are the most complex to instantiate, with a lot of different
options. Consequently, they expose a `Builder` interface. The simpler processors have
static factory methods instead.

== Direct Processor
A **Direct** `Processor` is a processor that can dispatch signals to zero to many
`Subscribers`. It is the simplest one to instantiate, with a single `DirectProcessor#create()` static
factory method. On the other hand, *it has the limitation of not handling backpressure*.
As a consequence, a `DirectProcessor` signals an `IllegalStateException` to its
subscribers if you push N elements through it but at least one of its subscribers has
requested less than N.

Once the `Processor` has terminated (usually through its sink's `error(Throwable)` or
`complete()` methods being called), it lets more subscribers subscribe but replays the
termination signal to them immediately.

== Unicast Processor
A **Unicast** `Processor` can deal with backpressure using an internal buffer. The trade-off
is that it can have *at most one* `Subscriber`.

A `UnicastProcessor` has a few more options, reflected by a few `create` static factory
methods. For instance, by default it is _unbounded_: if you push any amount of
data through it while its `Subscriber` has not yet requested data, it will buffer all of
the data.

This can be changed by providing a custom `Queue` implementation for the internal
buffering in the `create` factory method. If that queue is bounded, the processor could
reject the push of a value when the buffer is full and not enough requests from
downstream have been received.

In that _bounded_ case, the processor can also be built with a callback that is invoked
on each rejected element, allowing for cleanup of these rejected elements.

== Emitter Processor
An **Emitter** `Processor` is capable of emitting to several subscribers, while honoring
backpressure for each of its subscribers. It can also subscribe to a `Publisher` and
relay its signals synchronously.

Initially, when it has no subscriber, it can still accept a few data pushes up to a
configurable `bufferSize`. After that point, if no `Subscriber` has come in and consumed
the data, calls to `onNext` block until the processor is drained (which can only happen
concurrently by then).

Thus, the first `Subscriber` to subscribe receives up to `bufferSize` elements upon
subscribing. However, after that, the processor stops replaying signals to additional
subscribers. These subsequent subscribers instead only receive the signals pushed through
the processor *after* they have subscribed. The internal buffer is still used for
backpressure purposes.

By default, if all of its subscribers are cancelled (which basically means they have all
un-subscribed), it will clear its internal buffer and stop accepting new subscribers.
This can be tuned by the `autoCancel` parameter in the `create` static factory methods.

== Replay Processor
A **Replay** `Processor` caches elements that are either pushed directly through its `sink()`
or elements from an upstream `Publisher` and replays them to late subscribers.

It can be created in multiple configurations:

* Caching a single element (`cacheLast`).
* Caching a limited history (`create(int)`), unbounded history (`create()`).
* Caching time-based replay window (`createTimeout(Duration)`).
* Caching combination of history size and time window
(`createSizeOrTimeout(int, Duration)`).

== Topic Processor
A **Topic** `Processor` is an asynchronous processor capable of relaying elements from
multiple upstream `Publishers` when created in the `shared` configuration (see the
`share(boolean)` option of the `builder()`).

Note that the share option is mandatory if you intend to concurrently call
`TopicProcessor`'s `onNext`, `onComplete`, or `onError` methods directly or from a
concurrent upstream Publisher.

Otherwise, such concurrent calls are illegal, as the processor is then fully compliant
with the Reactive Streams specification.

A `TopicProcessor` is capable of fanning out to multiple `Subscribers`. It does so by
associating a `Thread` to each `Subscriber`, which will run until an `onError` or
`onComplete` signal is pushed through the processor or until the associated `Subscriber`
is cancelled. The maximum number of downstream subscribers is driven by the `executor`
builder option. Provide a bounded `ExecutorService` to limit it to a specific number.

The processor is backed by a `RingBuffer` data structure that stores pushed signals. Each
`Subscriber` thread keeps track of its associated demand and the correct indexes in the
`RingBuffer`.

This processor also has an `autoCancel` builder option: If set to `true` (the default),
it results in the source `Publisher`(s) being cancelled when all subscribers are
cancelled.

== WorkQueue Processor
A **WorkQueue** `Processor` is also an asynchronous processor capable of relaying elements
from multiple upstream `Publishers` when created in the `shared` configuration (it shares
most of its builder options with `TopicProcessor`).

It relaxes its compliance with the Reactive Streams specification, but it acquires the
benefit of requiring fewer resources than the `TopicProcessor`. It is still based on a
`RingBuffer` but avoids the overhead of creating one consumer `Thread` per `Subscriber`.
As a result, it scales better than the `TopicProcessor`.

The trade-off is that its distribution pattern is a little bit different: Requests from
each subscriber all add up together, and the processor relays signals to only one
`Subscriber` at a time, in a kind of round-robin distribution rather than fan-out
pattern.

NOTE: A fair round-robin distribution is not guaranteed.

The `WorkQueueProcessor` mostly has the same builder options as the `TopicProcessor`,
such as `autoCancel`, `share`, and `waitStrategy`. The maximum number of downstream
subscribers is also driven by a configurable `ExecutorService` with the `executor`
option.

WARNING: You should take care not to subscribe too many `Subscribers` to a
`WorkQueueProcessor`, as doing so *could lock the processor*. If you need to limit the
number of possible subscribers, prefer doing so by using a `ThreadPoolExecutor` or a
`ForkJoinPool`. The processor can detect their capacity and throw an exception if you
subscribe one too many times.

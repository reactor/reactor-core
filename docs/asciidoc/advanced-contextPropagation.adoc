= Context-Propagation Support

Since 3.5.0, Reactor-Core embeds support for the `io.micrometer:context-propagation` SPI.
This library is intended as a means to easily adapt between various implementations of the concept of a Context, of which
`ContextView`/`Context` is an example, and between `ThreadLocal` variables as well.

`ReactorContextAccessor` allows the Context-Propagation library to understand Reactor
`Context` and `ContextView`.
It implements the SPI and is loaded via `java.util.ServiceLoader`.
No user action is required, other than having a dependency on both reactor-core and `io.micrometer:context-propagation`. The `ReactorContextAccessor` class is public but shouldn't generally be accessed by user code.

Reactor-Core supports two modes of operation with `io.micrometer:context-propagation`:

- the **default** (limited) mode,
- and the **automatic** mode, enabled via `Hooks.enableAutomaticContextPropagation()`.
  Please note that this mode applies only to new subscriptions, so it is recommended to
enable this hook when the application starts.

Their key differences are discussed in the context of either <<context-writing, writing
data>> to Reactor `Context`, or <<context-accessing,accessing `ThreadLocal` state>> that
reflects the contents of the `Context` of currently attached `Subscriber` for reading.

[[context-writing]]
== Writing to `Context`

Depending on the individual application, you might either have to store already populated
`ThreadLocal` state as entries in the `Context`, or might only need to directly populate
the `Context`.

=== `contextWrite` Operator

When the values meant to be accessed as `ThreadLocal` are not (or do not need to be)
present at the time of subscription, they can immediately be stored in the `Context`:

====
[source,java]
----
// assuming TL is known to Context-Propagation as key TLKEY.
static final ThreadLocal<String> TL = new ThreadLocal<>();

// in the main Thread, TL is not set

Mono.deferContextual(ctx ->
  Mono.delay(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
      // we're now in another thread, TL is not explicitly set
      .map(v -> "delayed ctx[" + TLKEY + "]=" + ctx.getOrDefault(TLKEY, "not found") + ", TL=" + TL.get()))
.contextWrite(ctx -> ctx.put(TLKEY, "HELLO"))
.block(); // returns "delayed ctx[TLKEY]=HELLO, TL=null" in default mode
          // returns "delayed ctx[TLKEY]=HELLO, TL=HELLO" in automatic mode
----
====

=== `contextCapture` Operator
This operator can be used when one needs to capture `ThreadLocal` value(s) at subscription time and reflect these values in the Reactor `Context` for the benefit of upstream operators.

In contrast to the manual `contextWrite` operator, `contextCapture` uses the
`context-propagation` API to obtain a `ContextSnapshot` and then uses that snapshot
to populate the Reactor `Context`.

As a result, if there were any `ThreadLocal` values during subscription phase, for which there is a registered `ThreadLocalAccessor`, their values would now be stored in the Reactor `Context` and visible
at runtime in upstream operators.

====
[source,java]
----
// assuming TL is known to Context-Propagation as key TLKEY.
static final ThreadLocal<String> TL = new ThreadLocal<>();

// in the main Thread, TL is set to "HELLO"
TL.set("HELLO");

Mono.deferContextual(ctx ->
  Mono.delay(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
      // we're now in another thread, TL is not explicitly set
      .map(v -> "delayed ctx[" + TLKEY + "]=" + ctx.getOrDefault(TLKEY, "not found") + ", TL=" + TL.get()))
.contextCapture() // can be skipped in automatic mode when a blocking operator follows
.block(); // returns "delayed ctx[TLKEY]=HELLO, TL=null" in default mode
          // returns "delayed ctx[TLKEY]=HELLO, TL=HELLO" in automatic mode
----
====

NOTE: In the **automatic** mode, blocking operators, such as `Flux#blockFirst()`,
`Flux#blockLast()`, `Flux#toIterable()`, `Mono#block()`, `Mono#blockOptional()`, and
relevant overloads, all perform `contextCapture()` transparently, so in most cases it is
not necessary to add it.

[[context-accessing]]
== Accessing `ThreadLocal` state

Starting from Reactor-Core 3.5.0, `ThreadLocal` state is restored in a limited set
of operators. We call this behaviour the **default** (limited) mode. In 3.5.3, a new
mode was added, the **automatic** mode, which provides access to `ThreadLocal` values
throughout the reactive chain.

Reactor-Core performs `ThreadLocal` state restoration using the values
stored in `Context` and `ThreadLocalAccessor` instances registered in `ContextRegistry`
that match by key.

=== Default mode operators for snapshot restoration: `handle` and `tap`

In the **default** mode, both `Flux` and `Mono` variants of `handle` and `tap` will have
their behavior slightly modified if the Context-Propagation library is available at runtime.

Namely, if their downstream `ContextView` is not empty they will assume a context
capture has occurred (either manually or via the `contextCapture()` operator) and will attempt to restore ThreadLocals from that snapshot transparently. Any ThreadLocals for keys that are missing in the `ContextView` are left untouched.

These operators will ensure restoration is performed around the user-provided code, respectively:

- `handle` will wrap the `BiConsumer` in one which restores `ThreadLocal`s
- `tap` variants will wrap the `SignalListener` into one that has the same kind of wrapping around each method (this includes the `addToContext` method)

The intent is to have a minimalistic set of operators transparently perform restoration.
As a result we chose operators with rather general and broad applications (one with transformative capabilities, one with side-effect capabilities)

====
[source,java]
----
//assuming TL is known to Context-Propagation.
static final ThreadLocal<String> TL = new ThreadLocal<>();

//in the main thread, TL is set to "HELLO"
TL.set("HELLO");

Mono.delay(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
  //we're now in another thread, TL is not set yet
  .doOnNext(v -> System.out.println(TL.get()))
  //inside the handler however, TL _is_ restored
  .handle((v, sink) -> sink.next("handled delayed TL=" + TL.get()))
  .contextCapture()
  .block(); // prints "null" and returns "handled delayed TL=HELLO"
----
====

=== Automatic mode

In the **automatic** mode, all operators restore `ThreadLocal` state across `Thread`
boundaries. In contrast, in the **default** mode only selected operators do so.

`Hooks.enableAutomaticContextPropagation()` can be called upon application start to
enable the **automatic** mode. Please note that this mode applies only to new subscriptions,
so it is recommended to enable this hook when the application starts.

It is not an easy task to achieve, as the Reactive Streams specification makes reactive
chains `Thread`-agnostic. However, Reactor-Core does its best to control sources of
`Thread` switches and perform snapshot restoration based on the Reactor `Context`,
which is treated as the source of truth for `ThreadLocal` state.

WARNING: While the **default** mode limits the `ThreadLocal` state only to the user code
executed as arguments to the chosen operators, the **automatic** mode allows
`ThreadLocal` state to cross operator boundaries. This requires proper cleanup to avoid
leaking the state to unrelated code which reuses the same `Thread`. This requires to
treat absent keys in the `Context` for registered instances of `ThreadLocalAccessor` as
signals to clear the corresponding `ThreadLocal` state. This is especially important for
an empty `Context`, which clears all state for registered `ThreadLocalAccessor` instances.

== Which mode should I choose?

Both **default** and **automatic** modes have an impact on performance. Accessing
`ThreadLocal` variables can impact a reactive pipeline significantly. If the highest
scalability and performance is the goal, more verbose approaches for logging and
explicit argument passing can be considered instead of relying on `ThreadLocal` state. If
access to established libraries in the space of Observability, such as Micrometer and
SLF4J, which use `ThreadLocal` state for convenience to provide meaningful production
grade features is an understood compromise, the choice of the mode is yet another
compromise to make. The **automatic** mode, depending on the flow of your application and
the amount of operators used, can be either better or worse than the **default** mode. The
only recommendation that can be given is to measure how your application behaves and what
scalability and performance characteristics you obtain when presented with a load you
expect.

[[debugging]]
= Debugging Reactor

Switching from an imperative and synchronous programming paradigm to a reactive and
asynchronous one can sometimes be daunting. One of the steepest steps in the learning
curve is how to analyze and debug when something goes wrong.

In the imperative world, debugging is usually pretty straightforward. You can read the
stacktrace and see where the problem originated. Was it entirely a failure
of your code? Did the failure occur in some library code? If so, what part of your code
called the library, potentially passing in improper parameters that ultimately caused the
failure?

== The Typical Reactor Stack Trace

When you shift to asynchronous code, things can get much more complicated.

//TODO The code that generated the following stack trace should be here

Consider the following stack trace:

There is a lot going on there. We get an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, which tells us that
a `source emitted more than one item`.

We can probably quickly come to assume that this source is a Flux or a Mono, as confirmed by
the next line, which mentions `MonoSingle`. So it appears to be some sort of complaint
from a `single` operator.

Referring to the Javadoc for the `Mono#single` operator, we see that `single` has a contract:
The source must emit exactly one element. It appears we had a source that emitted more
than one and thus violated that contract.

Can we dig deeper and identify that source? The following rows are not very helpful. They
take us through the internals of what seems to be a reactive chain, through
multiple calls to `subscribe` and `request`.

By skimming over these rows, we can at least start to form a picture of the kind of chain
that went wrong: It seems to involve a `MonoSingle`, a `FluxFlatMap`, and a `FluxRange`
(each gets several rows in the trace, but overall these three classes are involved). So a
`range().flatMap().single()` chain maybe?

But what if we use that pattern a lot in our application? This still does not tell us
much, and simply searching for `single` is not going to find the problem. Then the last
line refers to some of our code. Finally, we are getting close.

Hold on, though. When we go to the source file, all we see is that a
pre-existing `Flux` is subscribed to, as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
toDebug.subscribe(System.out::println, Throwable::printStackTrace);
----
====

All of this happened at subscription time, but the `Flux` itself was not
declared there. Worse, when we go to where the variable is declared, we see the following:

====
[source,java]
----
public Mono<String> toDebug; //please overlook the public class attribute
----
====

The variable is not instantiated where it is declared. We must assume a worst-case
scenario where we find out that there could be a few different code paths that set it in
the application. We remain unsure of which one caused the issue.

NOTE: This is kind of the Reactor equivalent of a runtime error, as opposed to a
compilation error.

What we want to find out more easily is where the operator was added into the chain -
that is,  where the `Flux` was declared. We usually refer to that as the "`assembly`" of
the `Flux`.

[[debug-activate]]
== Activating Debug Mode

WARNING: this section describes the easiest but also the slowest way to enable
the debugging capabitilies due to the fact that it captures the stacktrace on every operator.
See <<checkpoint-alternative>> for a more fine grained way of debugging,
and <<reactor-tools-debug>> for a more advanced and performant global option.

Even though the stacktrace was still able to convey some information for someone with a
bit of experience, we can see that it is not ideal by itself in more advanced cases.

Fortunately, Reactor comes with  assembly-time instrumentation that is designed for debugging.

This is done by customizing the `Hooks.onOperator` hook at application start (or at
least before the incriminated `Flux` or `Mono` can be instantiated), as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
Hooks.onOperatorDebug();
----
====

This starts instrumenting the calls to the `Flux` (and `Mono`) operator  methods (where
they are assembled into the chain) by wrapping the construction of the operator and
capturing a stack trace there. Since this is done when the operator chain is declared, the
hook should be activated before that, so the safest way is to activate it right at the
start of your application.

Later on, if an exception occurs, the failing operator is able to refer to that capture
and append it to the stack trace.

In the next section, we see how the stack trace differs and how to interpret
that new information.

== Reading a Stack Trace in Debug Mode

When we reuse our initial example but activate the `operatorStacktrace` debug feature,
the stack trace is as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Source emitted more than one item
	at reactor.core.publisher.MonoSingle$SingleSubscriber.onNext(MonoSingle.java:129)
	at reactor.core.publisher.FluxOnAssembly$OnAssemblySubscriber.onNext(FluxOnAssembly.java:375) <1>
...
<2>
...
	at reactor.core.publisher.Mono.subscribeWith(Mono.java:3204)
	at reactor.core.publisher.Mono.subscribe(Mono.java:3090)
	at reactor.core.publisher.Mono.subscribe(Mono.java:3057)
	at reactor.core.publisher.Mono.subscribe(Mono.java:3029)
	at reactor.guide.GuideTests.debuggingActivated(GuideTests.java:1000)
	Suppressed: reactor.core.publisher.FluxOnAssembly$OnAssemblyException: <3>
Assembly trace from producer [reactor.core.publisher.MonoSingle] : <4>
	reactor.core.publisher.Flux.single(Flux.java:6676)
	reactor.guide.GuideTests.scatterAndGather(GuideTests.java:949)
	reactor.guide.GuideTests.populateDebug(GuideTests.java:962)
	org.junit.rules.TestWatcher$1.evaluate(TestWatcher.java:55)
	org.junit.rules.RunRules.evaluate(RunRules.java:20)
Error has been observed by the following operator(s): <5>
	|_	Flux.single â‡¢ reactor.guide.GuideTests.scatterAndGather(GuideTests.java:949) <6>
----
<1> This is new: We see the wrapper operator that captures the stack.
<2> Apart from that, the first section of the stack trace is still the same for the most
part, showing a bit of the operator's internals (so we removed a bit of the snippet here).
<3> This is where the new stuff from debugging mode starts to appear.
<4> First, we get some details about where the operator was assembled.
<5> We also get a traceback of the error as it propagated through the operator chain,
from first to last (error site to subscribe site).
<6> Each operator that saw the error is mentioned along with the user class and line where it
was used.
====

The captured stack trace is appended to the original error as a
suppressed `OnAssemblyException`. There are two parts to it, but the first section is the
most interesting. It shows the path of construction for the operator that triggered the
exception. Here, it shows that the `single` that caused our issue was created in the
`scatterAndGather` method, itself called from a `populateDebug` method that got executed
through JUnit.

Now that we are armed with enough information to find the culprit, we can have
a meaningful look at that `scatterAndGather` method:

====
[source,java]
----
private Mono<String> scatterAndGather(Flux<String> urls) {
    return urls.flatMap(url -> doRequest(url))
           .single(); <1>
}
----
<1> Sure enough, here is our `single`.
====

Now we can see what the root cause of the error was a `flatMap` that performs
several HTTP calls to a few URLs but that is chained with `single`, which is too
restrictive. After a short `git blame` and a quick discussion with the author of
that line, we find out he meant to use the less restrictive `take(1)` instead.

We have solved our problem.

Now consider the following line in the stack trace:

====
[source]
----
Error has been observed by the following operator(s):
----
====

That second part of the debug stack trace was not necessarily interesting in
this particular example, because the error was actually happening in the last
operator in the chain (the one closest to `subscribe`). Considering another
example might make it more clear:

====
[source,java]
----
FakeRepository.findAllUserByName(Flux.just("pedro", "simon", "stephane"))
              .transform(FakeUtils1.applyFilters)
              .transform(FakeUtils2.enrichUser)
              .blockLast();
----
====

Now imagine that, inside `findAllUserByName`, there is a `map` that fails. Here,
we would see the following final traceback:

====
[source,java]
----
Error has been observed by the following operator(s):
	|_	Flux.map â‡¢ reactor.guide.FakeRepository.findAllUserByName(FakeRepository.java:27)
	|_	Flux.map â‡¢ reactor.guide.FakeRepository.findAllUserByName(FakeRepository.java:28)
	|_	Flux.filter â‡¢ reactor.guide.FakeUtils1.lambda$static$1(FakeUtils1.java:29)
	|_	Flux.transform â‡¢ reactor.guide.GuideDebuggingExtraTests.debuggingActivatedWithDeepTraceback(GuideDebuggingExtraTests.java:40)
	|_	Flux.elapsed â‡¢ reactor.guide.FakeUtils2.lambda$static$0(FakeUtils2.java:30)
	|_	Flux.transform â‡¢ reactor.guide.GuideDebuggingExtraTests.debuggingActivatedWithDeepTraceback(GuideDebuggingExtraTests.java:41)
----
====

This corresponds to the section of the chain of operators that gets notified of the error:

. The exception originates in the first `map`.
. It is seen by a second `map` (both in fact correspond to the `findAllUserByName`
method).
. It is then seen by a `filter` and a `transform`, which indicate that part of the chain
is constructed by a reusable transformation function (here, the `applyFilters` utility
method).
. Finally, it is seen by an `elapsed` and a `transform`. Once again, `elapsed` is applied
by the transformation function of that second transform.

We deal with a form of instrumentation here, and creating a stack trace is costly. That
is why this debugging feature should only be activated in a controlled manner, as a last
resort.

[[checkpoint-alternative]]
=== The `checkpoint()` Alternative

The debug mode is global and affects every single operator assembled into a `Flux` or a
`Mono` inside the application. This has the benefit of allowing after-the-fact
debugging: Whatever the error, we can obtain additional information to debug it.

As we saw earlier, this global knowledge comes at the cost of an impact on performance
(due to the number of populated stack traces). That cost can be reduced if we have an
idea of likely problematic operators. However, we usually do not know which operators are
likely to be problematic unless we observed an error in the wild, saw we were missing
assembly information, and then modified the code to activate assembly tracking, hoping to
observe the same error again.

In that scenario, we have to switch into debugging mode and make preparations in order to
better observe a second occurrence of the error, this time capturing all the additional
information.

If you can identify reactive chains that you assemble in your application for which
serviceability is critical, you can achieve a mix of both techniques with the
`checkpoint()` operator.

You can chain this operator into a method chain. The `checkpoint` operator works like the
hook version but only for its link of that particular chain.

There is also a `checkpoint(String)` variant that lets you add a unique `String` identifier
to the assembly traceback. This way, the stack trace is omitted and you rely on the
description to identify the assembly site. `checkpoint(String)` imposes less processing
cost than a regular `checkpoint`.

//snippets are in FluxOnAssemblyTest
`checkpoint(String)` includes "`light`" in its output (which can be handy when
searching), as shown in the following example:

====
----
...
	Suppressed: reactor.core.publisher.FluxOnAssembly$OnAssemblyException:
Assembly site of producer [reactor.core.publisher.ParallelSource] is identified by light checkpoint [light checkpoint identifier].
----
====

Last but not least, if you want to add a more generic description to the checkpoint but
still rely on the stack trace mechanism to identify the assembly site, you can force that
behavior by using the `checkpoint("description", true)` version. We are now back to the
initial message for the traceback, augmented with a `description`, as shown in the
following example:

====
----
Assembly trace from producer [reactor.core.publisher.ParallelSource], described as [descriptionCorrelation1234] : <1>
	reactor.core.publisher.ParallelFlux.checkpoint(ParallelFlux.java:215)
	reactor.core.publisher.FluxOnAssemblyTest.parallelFluxCheckpointDescriptionAndForceStack(FluxOnAssemblyTest.java:225)
Error has been observed by the following operator(s):
	|_	ParallelFlux.checkpoint â‡¢ reactor.core.publisher.FluxOnAssemblyTest.parallelFluxCheckpointDescriptionAndForceStack(FluxOnAssemblyTest.java:225)
----
<1> `descriptionCorrelation1234` is the description provided in the `checkpoint`.
====

The description could be a static identifier or user-readable description or a wider
correlation ID (for instance, coming from a header in the case of an HTTP request).

NOTE: When both global debugging and local `checkpoint()` are enabled, checkpointed
snapshot stacks are appended as suppressed error output after the observing operator
graph and following the same declarative order.

[[reactor-tools-debug]]
== Production-ready Global Debugging
Project Reactor comes with a separate Java Agent that instruments your code and adds
debugging info without paying the cost of capturing the stacktrace on every operator call.
The behaviour is very similar to <<debug-activate>>, but without the runtime performance overhead.

To use it in your app, you must add it as a dependency.

The following example shows how to add `reactor-tools` as a dependency in Maven:

.reactor-tools in Maven, in `<dependencies>`
====
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactor-tools</artifactId>
    <1>
</dependency>
----
<1> If you use the <<getting,BOM>>, you do not need to specify a `<version>`.
====

The following example shows how to add `reactor-tools` as a dependency in Gradle:

.reactor-tools in Gradle, amend the `dependencies` block
====
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
   compile 'io.projectreactor:reactor-tools'
}
----
====

It also needs to be explicitly initialized with:
====
[source,java]
----
ReactorDebugAgent.init();
----
====

TIP: Since the implementation will instrument your classes when they are loaded,
the best place to put it is before everything else in your main(String[]) methood:
====
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ReactorDebugAgent.init();
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
}
----
====

You may also re-process existing classes if you cannot run the init eagerly (e.g. in the tests):
====
[source,java]
----
ReactorDebugAgent.init();
ReactorDebugAgent.processExistingClasses();
----
====

WARNING: Be aware that the re-processing takes a couple of seconds due to the need to iterate over
all loaded classes and apply the transformation.
Use it only if you see that some call-sites are not instrumented.

=== Limitations
`ReactorDebugAgent` is implemented as a Java Agent and uses https://bytebuddy.net/#/[ByteBuddy]
to perform the self-attach.
Self-attach may not work on some JVMs, please refer to ByteBuddy's documentation for more details.

== Logging a Sequence

In addition to stack trace debugging and analysis, another powerful tool to have in your
toolkit is the ability to trace and log events in an asynchronous sequence.

The `log()` operator can do just that. Chained inside a sequence, it peeks at every
event of the `Flux` or `Mono` upstream of it (including `onNext`, `onError`, and
`onComplete` as well as subscriptions, cancellations, and requests).

.A note on logging implementation
****
The `log` operator uses the `Loggers` utility class, which picks up common logging
frameworks such as Log4J and Logback through `SLF4J` and defaults to logging to the
console if SLF4J is unavailable.

The console fallback uses `System.err` for the `WARN` and `ERROR` log levels and
`System.out` for everything else.

If you prefer a JDK `java.util.logging` fallback, as in 3.0.x, you can get it by setting
the `reactor.logging.fallback` system property to `JDK`.

In all cases, when logging in production *you should take care to configure the
underlying logging framework to use its most asynchronous and non-blocking approach* --
for instance, an `AsyncAppender` in Logback or `AsyncLogger` in Log4j 2.
****

For instance, suppose we have Logback activated and configured and a chain like
`range(1,10).take(3)`. By placing a `log()` before the `take`, we can get some
insight into how it works and what kind of events it propagates upstream to the range,
as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux<Integer> flux = Flux.range(1, 10)
                         .log()
                         .take(3);
flux.subscribe();
----
====

This prints out the following (through the logger's console appender):

====
----
10:45:20.200 [main] INFO  reactor.Flux.Range.1 - | onSubscribe([Synchronous Fuseable] FluxRange.RangeSubscription) <1>
10:45:20.205 [main] INFO  reactor.Flux.Range.1 - | request(unbounded) <2>
10:45:20.205 [main] INFO  reactor.Flux.Range.1 - | onNext(1) <3>
10:45:20.205 [main] INFO  reactor.Flux.Range.1 - | onNext(2)
10:45:20.205 [main] INFO  reactor.Flux.Range.1 - | onNext(3)
10:45:20.205 [main] INFO  reactor.Flux.Range.1 - | cancel() <4>
----

Here, in addition to the logger's own formatter (time, thread, level, message), the
`log()` operator outputs a few things in its own format:

<1> `reactor.Flux.Range.1` is an automatic category for the log, in case you use the
operator several times in a chain. It lets you distinguish which operator's events
are logged (in this case, the `range`). You can overwrite the identifier with your own
custom category by using the `log(String)` method signature. After a few separating
characters, the actual event gets printed. Here, we get an `onSubscribe` call, a
`request` call, three `onNext` calls, and a `cancel` call. For the first line,
`onSubscribe`, we get the implementation of the `Subscriber`, which usually corresponds
to the operator-specific implementation. Between square brackets, we get additional
information, including whether the operator can be automatically optimized through
synchronous or asynchronous fusion.
<2> On the second line, we can see that an unbounded request was propagated up from
downstream.
<3> Then the range sends three values in a row.
<4> On the last line, we see `cancel()`.
====

The last line, (4), is the most interesting. We can see the `take` in action there. It
operates by cutting the sequence short after it has seen enough elements emitted. In
short, `take()` causes the source to `cancel()` once it has emitted the user-requested
amount.

[[core-features]]
= Reactor Core Features

The Reactor project main artifact is `reactor-core`, a reactive library that focuses on
the Reactive Streams specification and targets Java 8.

Reactor introduces composable reactive types that implement `Publisher` but also provide
a rich vocabulary of operators: `Flux` and `Mono`. A `Flux` object
represents a reactive sequence of 0..N items, while a `Mono` object represents a
single-value-or-empty (0..1) result.

This distinction carries a bit of semantic information into the type, indicating the
rough cardinality of the asynchronous processing. For instance, an HTTP request produces
only one response, so there is not much sense in doing a `count` operation. Expressing
the result of such an HTTP call as a `Mono<HttpResponse>` thus makes more sense than
expressing it as a `Flux<HttpResponse>`, as it offers only operators that are relevant to
a context of zero items or one item.

Operators that change the maximum cardinality of the processing also switch to the
relevant type. For instance, the `count` operator exists in `Flux`, but it returns a
`Mono<Long>`.

[[flux]]
== `Flux`, an Asynchronous Sequence of 0-N Items

The following image shows how a `Flux` transforms items:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactor/reactor-core/v3.0.7.RELEASE/src/docs/marble/flux.png[Flux]

A `Flux<T>` is a standard `Publisher<T>` that represents an asynchronous sequence of 0 to N
emitted items, optionally terminated by either a completion signal or an error.
As in the Reactive Streams spec, these three types of signal translate to calls to a downstream
Subscriber's `onNext`, `onComplete`, and `onError` methods.

With this large scope of possible signals, `Flux` is the general-purpose reactive type.
Note that all events, even terminating ones, are optional: no `onNext` event but an
`onComplete` event represents an _empty_ finite sequence, but remove the `onComplete` and
you have an _infinite_ empty sequence (not particularly useful, except for tests around cancellation).
Similarly, infinite sequences are not necessarily empty. For example, `Flux.interval(Duration)`
produces a `Flux<Long>` that is infinite and emits regular ticks from a clock.

[[mono]]
== `Mono`, an Asynchronous 0-1 Result

The following image shows how a `Mono` transforms an item:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactor/reactor-core/v3.0.7.RELEASE/src/docs/marble/mono.png[Mono]

A `Mono<T>` is a specialized `Publisher<T>` that emits at most one item and then
(optionally) terminates with an `onComplete` signal or an `onError` signal.

It offers only a subset of the operators that are available for a `Flux`, and
some operators (notably those that combine the `Mono` with another `Publisher`)
switch to a `Flux`.
For example, `Mono#concatWith(Publisher)` returns a `Flux` while `Mono#then(Mono)`
returns another `Mono`.

Note that you can use a `Mono` to represent no-value asynchronous processes that only
have the concept of completion (similar to a `Runnable`). To create one, you can use an empty
`Mono<Void>`.

== Simple Ways to Create a Flux or Mono and Subscribe to It

The easiest way to get started with `Flux` and `Mono` is to use one of the numerous
factory methods found in their respective classes.

For instance, to create a sequence of `String`, you can either enumerate them or put them
in a collection and create the Flux from it, as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> seq1 = Flux.just("foo", "bar", "foobar");

List<String> iterable = Arrays.asList("foo", "bar", "foobar");
Flux<String> seq2 = Flux.fromIterable(iterable);
----
====

Other examples of factory methods include the following:

====
[source,java]
----
Mono<String> noData = Mono.empty(); <1>

Mono<String> data = Mono.just("foo");

Flux<Integer> numbersFromFiveToSeven = Flux.range(5, 3); <2>
----
<1> Notice the factory method honors the generic type even though it has no value.
<2> The first parameter is the start of the range, while the second parameter is the
number of items to produce.
====

When it comes to subscribing, `Flux` and `Mono` make use of Java 8 lambdas. You
have a wide choice of `.subscribe()` variants that take lambdas for different
combinations of callbacks, as shown in the following method signatures:

[[subscribeMethods]]
.Lambda-based subscribe variants for `Flux`
====
[source,java]
----
subscribe(); <1>

subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer); <2>

subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer,
          Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer); <3>

subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer,
          Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer,
          Runnable completeConsumer); <4>

subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer,
          Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer,
          Runnable completeConsumer,
          Consumer<? super Subscription> subscriptionConsumer); <5>
----
<1> Subscribe and trigger the sequence.
<2> Do something with each produced value.
<3> Deal with values but also react to an error.
<4> Deal with values and errors but also run some code when the sequence successfully
completes.
<5> Deal with values and errors and successful completion but also do something with the
`Subscription` produced by this `subscribe` call.
====

TIP: These variants return a reference to the subscription that you can use to cancel the
subscription when no more data is needed. Upon cancellation, the source should stop
producing values and clean up any resources it created. This cancel-and-clean-up behavior
is represented in Reactor by the general-purpose `Disposable` interface.

[[schedulers]]
== Threading and Schedulers

Reactor, like RxJava, can be considered to be *concurrency-agnostic*. That is, it does not
enforce a concurrency model. Rather, it leaves you, the developer, in command. However,
that does not prevent the library from helping you with concurrency.

Obtaining a `Flux` or a `Mono` does not necessarily mean that it runs in a dedicated
`Thread`. Instead, most operators continue working in the `Thread` on which the
previous operator executed. Unless specified, the topmost operator (the source)
itself runs on the `Thread` in which the `subscribe()` call was made. The following
example runs a `Mono` in a new thread:

====
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
  final Mono<String> mono = Mono.just("hello "); //<1>

  Thread t = new Thread(() -> mono
      .map(msg -> msg + "thread ")
      .subscribe(v -> //<2>
          System.out.println(v + Thread.currentThread().getName()) //<3>
      )
  )
  t.start();
  t.join();

}
----
<1> The `Mono<String>` is assembled in thread `main`.
<2> However, it is subscribed to in thread `Thread-0`.
<3> As a consequence, both the `map` and the `onNext` callback actually run in `Thread-0`
====

The preceding code produces the following output:

====
[source]
----
hello thread Thread-0
----
====

In Reactor, the execution model and where the execution happens is determined by the
`Scheduler` that is used. A
https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Scheduler.html[`Scheduler`]
has scheduling responsibilities similar to an `ExecutorService`, but having a
dedicated abstraction lets it do more, notably acting as a clock and enabling
a wider range of implementations (virtual time for tests, trampolining or
immediate scheduling, and so on).

The https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Schedulers.html[`Schedulers`]
class has static methods that give access to the following execution contexts:

 * No execution context (`Schedulers.immediate()`): at processing time, the submitted `Runnable`
will be directly executed, effectively running them on the current `Thread` (can be seen as a "null object" or no-op `Scheduler`).
 * A single, reusable thread (`Schedulers.single()`). Note that this method reuses the
same thread for all callers, until the Scheduler is disposed. If you want a per-call
dedicated thread, use `Schedulers.newSingle()` for each call.
* An unbounded elastic thread pool (`Schedulers.elastic()`). This one is no longer preferred
with the introduction of `Schedulers.boundedElastic()`, as it has a tendency to hide backpressure
problems and lead to too many threads (see below).
* A bounded elastic thread pool (`Schedulers.boundedElastic()`). Like its predecessor `elastic()`, it
creates new worker pools as needed and reuses idle ones. Worker pools that stay idle for too long (the default is 60s) are
also disposed. Unlike its `elastic()` predecessor, it has a cap on the number of backing threads it can create (default is number of CPU cores x 10).
Up to 100 000 tasks submitted after the cap has been reached are enqueued and will be re-scheduled when a thread becomes available
(when scheduling with a delay, the delay starts when the thread becomes available). This is a better choice for I/O blocking work.
`Schedulers.boundedElastic()` is a handy way to give a blocking process its own thread so that
it does not tie up other resources. See <<faq.wrap-blocking>>, but doesn't pressure the system too much with new threads.
* A fixed pool of workers that is tuned for parallel work (`Schedulers.parallel()`). It
creates as many workers as you have CPU cores.

Additionally, you can create a `Scheduler` out of any pre-existing `ExecutorService` by
using `Schedulers.fromExecutorService(ExecutorService)`. (You can also create one from an
`Executor`, although doing so is discouraged.)

You can also create new instances of the various scheduler types by using the `newXXX`
methods. For example, `Schedulers.newParallel(yourScheduleName)` creates a new parallel
scheduler named `yourScheduleName`.

[WARNING]
====
While `boundedElastic` is made to help with legacy blocking code if it cannot be avoided,
`single` and `parallel` are not. As a consequence, the use of Reactor blocking APIs
(`block()`, `blockFirst()`, `blockLast()` (as well as iterating over `toIterable()`
or `toStream()`) inside the default single and parallel schedulers) results in
an `IllegalStateException` being thrown.

Custom `Schedulers` can also be marked as "non blocking only" by creating instances of `Thread`
that implement the `NonBlocking` marker interface.
====

Some operators use a specific scheduler from `Schedulers` by default (and usually give
you the option of providing a different one). For instance, calling the
`Flux.interval(Duration.ofMillis(300))` factory method produces a `Flux<Long>` that ticks every 300ms.
By default, this is enabled by `Schedulers.parallel()`. The following line changes the
Scheduler to a new instance similar to `Schedulers.single()`:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux.interval(Duration.ofMillis(300), Schedulers.newSingle("test"))
----
====

Reactor offers two means of switching the execution context (or `Scheduler`) in a
reactive chain: `publishOn` and `subscribeOn`. Both take a `Scheduler` and let you switch
the execution context to that scheduler. But the placement of `publishOn` in the chain
matters, while the placement of `subscribeOn` does not. To understand that difference,
you first have to remember that <<reactive.subscribe,nothing happens until you
subscribe>>.

In Reactor, when you chain operators, you can wrap as many `Flux` and `Mono`
implementations inside one another as you need. Once you subscribe, a chain of
`Subscriber` objects is created, backward (up the chain) to the first
publisher. This is effectively hidden from you. All you can see is the outer layer of
`Flux` (or `Mono`) and `Subscription`, but these intermediate operator-specific
subscribers are where the real work happens.

With that knowledge, we can have a closer look at the `publishOn` and `subscribeOn`
operators:

=== The `publishOn` Method

`publishOn` applies in the same way as any other operator, in the middle of the
subscriber chain. It takes signals from upstream and replays them downstream while
executing the callback on a worker from the associated `Scheduler`. Consequently, it
*affects where the subsequent operators execute* (until another `publishOn` is
chained in), as follows:

* Changes the execution context to one `Thread` picked by the `Scheduler`
* as per the specification, `onNext` calls happen in sequence, so this uses up a single thread
* unless they work on a specific `Scheduler`, operators after `publishOn` continue execution on that same thread

The following example uses the `publishOn` method:

====
[source,java]
----
Scheduler s = Schedulers.newParallel("parallel-scheduler", 4); //<1>

final Flux<String> flux = Flux
    .range(1, 2)
    .map(i -> 10 + i)  //<2>
    .publishOn(s)  //<3>
    .map(i -> "value " + i);  //<4>

new Thread(() -> flux.subscribe(System.out::println));  //<5>
----
<1> Creates a new `Scheduler` backed by four `Thread` instances.
<2> The first `map` runs on the anonymous thread in <5>.
<3> The `publishOn` switches the whole sequence on a `Thread` picked from <1>.
<4> The second `map` runs on the `Thread` from <1>.
<5> This anonymous `Thread` is the one where the _subscription_ happens.
The print happens on the latest execution context, which is the one from `publishOn`.
====

=== The `subscribeOn` Method

`subscribeOn` applies to the subscription process, when that backward chain is
constructed. As a consequence, no matter where you place the `subscribeOn` in the chain,
*it always affects the context of the source emission*. However, this does not affect the
behavior of subsequent calls to `publishOn` -- they still switch the execution context for
the part of the chain after them.

* Changes the `Thread` from which the *whole chain* of operators subscribes
* Picks one thread from the `Scheduler`

NOTE: Only the earliest `subscribeOn` call in the chain is actually taken into account.

The following example uses the `subscribeOn` method:

====
[source,java]
----
Scheduler s = Schedulers.newParallel("parallel-scheduler", 4); //<1>

final Flux<String> flux = Flux
    .range(1, 2)
    .map(i -> 10 + i)  //<2>
    .subscribeOn(s)  //<3>
    .map(i -> "value " + i);  //<4>

new Thread(() -> flux.subscribe(System.out::println));  //<5>
----
<1> Creates a new `Scheduler` backed by four `Thread`.
<2> The first `map` runs on one of these four threads...
<3> ...because `subscribeOn` switches the whole sequence right from subscription time (<5>).
<4> The second `map` also runs on same thread.
<5> This anonymous `Thread` is the one where the _subscription_ initially happens, but `subscribeOn` immediately shifts it to one of the four scheduler threads.
====

[[error.handling]]
== Handling Errors

TIP: For a quick look at the available operators for error handling, see
<<which.errors,the relevant operator decision tree>>.

In Reactive Streams, errors are terminal events. As soon as an error occurs, it stops the
sequence and gets propagated down the chain of operators to the last step, the
`Subscriber` you defined and its `onError` method.

Such errors should still be dealt with at the application level. For instance, you might
display an error notification in a UI or send a meaningful error payload in a REST
endpoint. For this reason, the subscriber's `onError` method should always be defined.

WARNING: If not defined, `onError` throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`. You can
further detect and triage it with the `Exceptions.isErrorCallbackNotImplemented` method.

Reactor also offers alternative means of dealing with errors in the middle of the chain,
as error-handling operators. The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux.just(1, 2, 0)
    .map(i -> "100 / " + i + " = " + (100 / i)) //this triggers an error with 0
    .onErrorReturn("Divided by zero :("); // error handling example
----
====

IMPORTANT: Before you learn about error-handling operators, you must keep in mind that
_any error in a reactive sequence is a terminal event_. Even if an error-handling
operator is used, it does not let the original sequence continue. Rather, it
converts the `onError` signal into the start of a new sequence (the fallback one). In
other words, it replaces the terminated sequence _upstream_ of it.

Now we can consider each means of error handling one-by-one. When relevant, we make a
parallel with imperative programming's `try` patterns.

=== Error Handling Operators

You may be familiar with several ways of dealing with exceptions in a try-catch block.
Most notably, these include the following:

* Catch and return a static default value.
* Catch and execute an alternative path with a fallback method.
* Catch and dynamically compute a fallback value.
* Catch, wrap to a `BusinessException`, and re-throw.
* Catch, log an error-specific message, and re-throw.
* Use the `finally` block to clean up resources or a Java 7 "`try-with-resource`" construct.

All of these have equivalents in Reactor, in the form of error-handling operators.
Before looking into these operators, we first want to establish a parallel between a reactive
chain and a try-catch block.

When subscribing, the `onError` callback at the end of the chain is akin to a `catch`
block. There, execution skips to the catch in case an `Exception` is thrown, as the
following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> s = Flux.range(1, 10)
    .map(v -> doSomethingDangerous(v)) // <1>
    .map(v -> doSecondTransform(v)); // <2>
s.subscribe(value -> System.out.println("RECEIVED " + value), // <3>
            error -> System.err.println("CAUGHT " + error) // <4>
);
----
<1> A transformation that can throw an exception is performed.
<2> If everything went well, a second transformation is performed.
<3> Each successfully transformed value is printed out.
<4> In case of an error, the sequence terminates and an error message is displayed.
====

The preceding example is conceptually similar to the following try-catch block:

====
[source,java]
----
try {
    for (int i = 1; i < 11; i++) {
        String v1 = doSomethingDangerous(i); // <1>
        String v2 = doSecondTransform(v1); // <2>
        System.out.println("RECEIVED " + v2);
    }
} catch (Throwable t) {
    System.err.println("CAUGHT " + t); // <3>
}
----
<1> If an exception is thrown here...
<2> ...the rest of the loop is skipped...
<3> ... and the execution goes straight to here.
====

Now that we have established a parallel, we can look at the different error handling cases
and their equivalent operators.

==== Static Fallback Value

The equivalent of "`Catch and return a static default value`" is `onErrorReturn`.
The following example shows how to use it:

====
[source,java]
----
try {
  return doSomethingDangerous(10);
}
catch (Throwable error) {
  return "RECOVERED";
}
----
====

The following example shows the Reactor equivalent:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux.just(10)
    .map(this::doSomethingDangerous)
    .onErrorReturn("RECOVERED");
----
====

You also have the option of applying a `Predicate` on the exception to decided
whether or not to recover, as the folloiwng example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux.just(10)
    .map(this::doSomethingDangerous)
    .onErrorReturn(e -> e.getMessage().equals("boom10"), "recovered10"); //<1>
----
<1> Recover only if the message of the exception is `"boom10"`
====

==== Fallback Method

If you want more than a single default value and you have an alternative (safer) way of
processing your data, you can use `onErrorResume`. This would be the equivalent of
"`Catch and execute an alternative path with a fallback method`".

For example, if your nominal process is fetching data from an external and unreliable
service but you also keep a local cache of the same data that _can_ be a bit more out of
date but is more reliable, you could do the following:

====
[source,java]
----
String v1;
try {
  v1 = callExternalService("key1");
}
catch (Throwable error) {
  v1 = getFromCache("key1");
}

String v2;
try {
  v2 = callExternalService("key2");
}
catch (Throwable error) {
  v2 = getFromCache("key2");
}
----
====

The following example shows the Reactor equivalent:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux.just("key1", "key2")
    .flatMap(k -> callExternalService(k) // <1>
        .onErrorResume(e -> getFromCache(k)) // <2>
    );
----
<1> For each key, asynchronously call the external service.
<2> If the external service call fails, fall back to the cache for that key. Note that
we always apply the same fallback, whatever the source error, `e`, is.
====

Like `onErrorReturn`, `onErrorResume` has variants that let you filter which exceptions
to fall back on, based either on the exception's class or on a `Predicate`. The fact that it
takes a `Function` also lets you choose a different fallback sequence to switch to,
depending on the error encountered. The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux.just("timeout1", "unknown", "key2")
    .flatMap(k -> callExternalService(k)
        .onErrorResume(error -> { // <1>
            if (error instanceof TimeoutException) // <2>
                return getFromCache(k);
            else if (error instanceof UnknownKeyException)  // <3>
                return registerNewEntry(k, "DEFAULT");
            else
                return Flux.error(error); // <4>
        })
    );
----
<1> The function allows dynamically choosing how to continue.
<2> If the source times out, hit the local cache.
<3> If the source says the key is unknown, create a new entry.
<4> In all other cases, "`re-throw`".
====

==== Dynamic Fallback Value

Even if you do not have an alternative (safer) way of processing your data, you might want
to compute a fallback value out of the exception you received. This would be the
equivalent of "`Catch and dynamically compute a fallback value`".

For instance, if your return type (`MyWrapper`) has a variant dedicated to holding an exception (think
`Future.complete(T success)` versus `Future.completeExceptionally(Throwable error)`), you
could instantiate the error-holding variant and pass the exception.

An imperative example would look like the following:

====
[source,java]
----
try {
  Value v = erroringMethod();
  return MyWrapper.fromValue(v);
}
catch (Throwable error) {
  return MyWrapper.fromError(error);
}
----
====

You can do this reactively in the same way as the fallback method solution,
by using `onErrorResume`, with a tiny bit of boilerplate, as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
erroringFlux.onErrorResume(error -> Mono.just( // <1>
        MyWrapper.fromError(error) // <2>
));
----
<1> Since you expect a `MyWrapper` representation of the error, you need to get a
`Mono<MyWrapper>` for `onErrorResume`. We use `Mono.just()` for that.
<2> We need to compute the value out of the exception. Here, we achieved that
by wrapping the exception with a relevant `MyWrapper` factory method.
====

==== Catch and Rethrow

"Catch, wrap to a `BusinessException`, and re-throw" looks like the following in the
imperative world:

====
[source,java]
----
try {
  return callExternalService(k);
}
catch (Throwable error) {
  throw new BusinessException("oops, SLA exceeded", error);
}
----
====

In the "`fallback method`" example, the last line inside the `flatMap` gives us a hint
at achieving the same reactively, as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux.just("timeout1")
    .flatMap(k -> callExternalService(k))
    .onErrorResume(original -> Flux.error(
            new BusinessException("oops, SLA exceeded", original))
    );
----
====

However, there is a more straightforward way of achieving the same effect with `onErrorMap`:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux.just("timeout1")
    .flatMap(k -> callExternalService(k))
    .onErrorMap(original -> new BusinessException("oops, SLA exceeded", original));
----
====

==== Log or React on the Side

For cases where you want the error to continue propagating but still want to react to
it without modifying the sequence (logging it, for instance), you can use the `doOnError`
operator. This is the equivalent of "`Catch, log an error-specific message, and re-throw`"
pattern, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
try {
  return callExternalService(k);
}
catch (RuntimeException error) {
  //make a record of the error
  log("uh oh, falling back, service failed for key " + k);
  throw error;
}
----
====

The `doOnError` operator, as well as all operators prefixed with `doOn` , are sometimes
referred to as having a "`side-effect`". They let you peek inside the sequence's events without
modifying them.

Like the imperative example shown earlier, the following example still propagates the error yet
ensures that we at least log that the external service had a failure:

====
[source,java]
----
LongAdder failureStat = new LongAdder();
Flux<String> flux =
Flux.just("unknown")
    .flatMap(k -> callExternalService(k) // <1>
        .doOnError(e -> {
            failureStat.increment();
            log("uh oh, falling back, service failed for key " + k); // <2>
        })
        // <3>
    );
----
<1> The external service call that can fail...
<2> ...is decorated with a logging and stats side-effect...
<3> ...after which, it still terminates with an error, unless we use an error-recovery operator here.
====

We can also imagine we have statistic counters to increment as a second error side-effect.

==== Using Resources and the Finally Block

The last parallel to draw with imperative programming is the cleaning up that can be done
either by using a "`Use of the `finally` block to clean up resources`" or by using a
"`Java 7 try-with-resource construct`", both shown below:

.Imperative use of finally
====
[source,java]
----
Stats stats = new Stats();
stats.startTimer();
try {
  doSomethingDangerous();
}
finally {
  stats.stopTimerAndRecordTiming();
}
----
====

.Imperative use of try-with-resource
====
[source,java]
----
try (SomeAutoCloseable disposableInstance = new SomeAutoCloseable()) {
  return disposableInstance.toString();
}
----
====

Both have their Reactor equivalents: `doFinally` and `using`.

`doFinally` is about side-effects that you want to be executed whenever the
sequence terminates (with `onComplete` or `onError`) or is cancelled.
It gives you a hint as to what kind of termination triggered the side-effect.
The following example shows how to use `doFinally`:

====
[source,java]
.Reactive finally: `doFinally()`
----
Stats stats = new Stats();
LongAdder statsCancel = new LongAdder();

Flux<String> flux =
Flux.just("foo", "bar")
    .doOnSubscribe(s -> stats.startTimer())
    .doFinally(type -> { // <1>
        stats.stopTimerAndRecordTiming();// <2>
        if (type == SignalType.CANCEL) // <3>
          statsCancel.increment();
    })
    .take(1); // <4>
----
<1> `doFinally` consumes a `SignalType` for the type of termination.
<2> Similarly to `finally` blocks, we always record the timing.
<3> Here we also increment statistics in case of cancellation only.
<4> `take(1)` cancels after one item is emitted.
====

On the other hand, `using` handles the case where a `Flux` is derived from a
resource and that resource must be acted upon whenever processing is done.
In the following example, we replace the `AutoCloseable` interface of "`try-with-resource`" with a
`Disposable`:

.The Disposable resource
====
[source,java]
----
AtomicBoolean isDisposed = new AtomicBoolean();
Disposable disposableInstance = new Disposable() {
    @Override
    public void dispose() {
        isDisposed.set(true); // <4>
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "DISPOSABLE";
    }
};
----
====

Now we can do the reactive equivalent of "`try-with-resource`" on it, which looks
like the following:

.Reactive try-with-resource: `using()`
====
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> flux =
Flux.using(
        () -> disposableInstance, // <1>
        disposable -> Flux.just(disposable.toString()), // <2>
        Disposable::dispose // <3>
);
----
<1> The first lambda generates the resource. Here, we return our mock `Disposable`.
<2> The second lambda processes the resource, returning a `Flux<T>`.
<3> The third lambda is called when the `Flux` from <2> terminates or is cancelled, to
clean up resources.
<4> After subscription and execution of the sequence, the `isDisposed` atomic boolean
becomes `true`.

==== Demonstrating the Terminal Aspect of `onError`

In order to demonstrate that all these operators cause the upstream original sequence to
terminate when an error happens, we can use a more visual example with a
`Flux.interval`. The `interval` operator ticks every x units of time with an increasing
`Long` value. The following example uses an `interval` operator:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> flux =
Flux.interval(Duration.ofMillis(250))
    .map(input -> {
        if (input < 3) return "tick " + input;
        throw new RuntimeException("boom");
    })
    .onErrorReturn("Uh oh");

flux.subscribe(System.out::println);
Thread.sleep(2100); // <1>
----
<1> Note that `interval` executes on a *timer* `Scheduler` by default. If we want
to run that example in a main class, we would need to add a `sleep` call here so that the
application does not exit immediately without any value being produced.
====

The preceding example prints out one line every 250ms, as follows:

====
[source]
----
tick 0
tick 1
tick 2
Uh oh
----
====

Even with one extra second of runtime, no more tick comes in from the `interval`. The
sequence was indeed terminated by the error.

==== Retrying

There is another operator of interest with regards to error handling, and you might be
tempted to use it in the case described in the previous section. `retry`, as its name
indicates, lets you retry an error-producing sequence.

The thing to keep in mind is that it works by *re-subscribing* to the upstream `Flux`.
This is really a different sequence, and the original one is still terminated.
To verify that, we can re-use the previous example and append a `retry(1)` to
retry once instead of using `onErrorReturn`. The following example shows how to do sl:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux.interval(Duration.ofMillis(250))
    .map(input -> {
        if (input < 3) return "tick " + input;
        throw new RuntimeException("boom");
    })
    .retry(1)
    .elapsed() // <1>
    .subscribe(System.out::println, System.err::println); // <2>

Thread.sleep(2100); // <3>
----
<1> `elapsed` associates each value with the duration since previous value was emitted.
<2> We also want to see when there is an `onError`.
<3> Ensure we have enough time for our 4x2 ticks.
====

The preceding example produces the following output:

====
[source]
----
259,tick 0
249,tick 1
251,tick 2
506,tick 0 <1>
248,tick 1
253,tick 2
java.lang.RuntimeException: boom
----
<1> A new `interval` started, from tick 0. The additional 250ms duration is
coming from the 4th tick, the one that causes the exception and subsequent
retry.
====

As you can see from the preceding example, `retry(1)` merely re-subscribed to the original `interval`
once, restarting the tick from 0. The second time around, since the exception
still occurs, it gives up and propagates the error downstream.

There is a more advanced version of `retry` (called `retryWhen`) that uses a "`companion`"
`Flux` to tell whether or not a particular failure should retry. This companion `Flux` is
created by the operator but decorated by the user, in order to customize the retry
condition.

The companion `Flux` is a `Flux<Throwable>` that gets passed to a `Function`, the sole
parameter of `retryWhen`. As the user, you define that function and make it return a new
`Publisher<?>`. Retry cycles go as follows:

. Each time an error happens (giving potential for a retry), the error is emitted into the
companion `Flux`, which has been decorated by your function. Having a `Flux` here
gives a bird eye's view of all the attempts so far.
. If the companion `Flux` emits a value, a retry happens.
. If the companion `Flux` completes, the error is swallowed, the retry cycle stops,
and the resulting sequence completes, too.
. If the companion `Flux` produces an error (`e`), the retry cycle stops and the
resulting sequence errors with `e`.

The distinction between the previous two cases is important. Simply completing the
companion would effectively swallow an error. Consider the following way of emulating
`retry(3)` by using `retryWhen`:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> flux = Flux
    .<String>error(new IllegalArgumentException()) // <1>
    .doOnError(System.out::println) // <2>
    .retryWhen(companion -> companion.take(3)); // <3>
----
<1> This continuously produces errors, calling for retry attempts.
<2> `doOnError` before the retry lets us log and see all failures.
<3> Here, we consider the first three errors as retry-able (`take(3)`) and then give up.
====

In effect, the preceding example results in an empty `Flux`, but it completes successfully. Since
`retry(3)` on the same `Flux` would have terminated with the latest error, this
`retryWhen` example is not exactly the same as a `retry(3)`.

Getting to the same behavior involves a few additional tricks:

TIP: You can use similar code to implement an "`exponential backoff and retry`" pattern,
as shown in the <<faq.exponentialBackoff,FAQ>>.

=== Handling Exceptions in Operators or Functions

In general, all operators can themselves contain code that potentially trigger an
exception or calls to a user-defined callback that can similarly fail, so they all
contain some form of error handling.

As a rule of thumb, an unchecked exception is always propagated through `onError`. For
instance, throwing a `RuntimeException` inside a `map` function translates to an
`onError` event, as the following code shows:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux.just("foo")
    .map(s -> { throw new IllegalArgumentException(s); })
    .subscribe(v -> System.out.println("GOT VALUE"),
               e -> System.out.println("ERROR: " + e));
----
====

The preceding code prints out the following:

====
[source]
----
ERROR: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: foo
----
====

TIP: You can tune the `Exception` before it is passed to `onError`, through the use of a
<<hooks-internal,hook>>.

Reactor, however, defines a set of exceptions (such as `OutOfMemoryError`) that are
always deemed to be fatal. See the `Exceptions.throwIfFatal` method. These errors mean that
Reactor cannot keep operating and are thrown rather than propagated.

NOTE: Internally, there are also cases where an unchecked exception still cannot be
propagated (most notably during the subscribe and request phases), due to concurrency
races that could lead to double `onError` or `onComplete` conditions. When these races
happen, the error that cannot be propagated is "`dropped`". These cases can still be
managed to some extent by using customizable hooks. See <<hooks-dropping>>.

You may ask: "`What about checked exceptions?`"

If, for example, you need to call some method that declares it `throws` exceptions, you
still have to deal with those exceptions in a `try-catch` block. You have several
options, though:

. Catch the exception and recover from it. The sequence continues normally.
. Catch the exception, wrap it into an _unchecked_ exception, and then throw it
(interrupting the sequence). The `Exceptions` utility class can help you with that (we
get to that next).
. If you need to return a `Flux` (for example, you are in a `flatMap`), wrap the
exception in an error-producing `Flux`, as follows: `return Flux.error(checkedException)`. (The
sequence also terminates.)

Reactor has an `Exceptions` utility class that you can use to ensure that exceptions are
wrapped only if they are checked exceptions:

* Use the `Exceptions.propagate` method to wrap exceptions, if necessary. It also calls
`throwIfFatal` first and does not wrap `RuntimeException`.
* Use the `Exceptions.unwrap` method to get the original unwrapped exception (going back
to the root cause of a hierarchy of reactor-specific exceptions).

Consider the following example of a `map` that uses a conversion method that can throw an
`IOException`:

====
[source,java]
----
public String convert(int i) throws IOException {
    if (i > 3) {
        throw new IOException("boom " + i);
    }
    return "OK " + i;
}
----
====

Now imagine that you want to use that method in a `map`. You must now explicitly catch
the exception, and your map function cannot re-throw it. So you can propagate it to the
map's `onError` method as a `RuntimeException`, as follows:

====
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> converted = Flux
    .range(1, 10)
    .map(i -> {
        try { return convert(i); }
        catch (IOException e) { throw Exceptions.propagate(e); }
    });
----
====

Later on, when subscribing to the preceding `Flux` and reacting to errors (such as in the
UI), you could revert back to the original exception if you want to do something
special for IOExceptions. The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java]
----
converted.subscribe(
    v -> System.out.println("RECEIVED: " + v),
    e -> {
        if (Exceptions.unwrap(e) instanceof IOException) {
            System.out.println("Something bad happened with I/O");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Something bad happened");
        }
    }
);

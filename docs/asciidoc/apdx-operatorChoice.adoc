[[which-operator]]
= Which operator do I need?

TIP: In this section, if an operator is specific to `Flux` or `Mono`, it is
prefixed accordingly. Common operators have no prefix. When a specific use case
is covered by a combination of operators, it is presented as a method call, with
leading dot and parameters in parentheses, as follows: `.methodCall(parameter)`.

//TODO flux:  publishOn/subscribeOn/cancelOn
//transformDeferred/transform, repeatWhen, sort, startWith
//TODO Mono.sequenceEqual

[[which.create]]
== Creating a New Sequence...

* that emits a `T`, and I already have: `just`
** ...from an `Optional<T>`: `Mono#justOrEmpty(Optional<T>)`
** ...from a potentially `null` T: `Mono#justOrEmpty(T)`
* that emits a `T` returned by a method: `just` as well
** ...but lazily captured: use `Mono#fromSupplier` or wrap `just` inside `defer`
* that emits several `T` I can explicitly enumerate: `Flux#just(T...)`
* that iterates over:
** an array: `Flux#fromArray`
** a collection or iterable: `Flux#fromIterable`
** a range of integers: `Flux#range`
** a `Stream` supplied for each Subscription: `Flux#fromStream(Supplier<Stream>)`
* that emits from various single-valued sources such as:
** a `Supplier<T>`: `Mono#fromSupplier`
** a task: `Mono#fromCallable`, `Mono#fromRunnable`
** a `CompletableFuture<T>`: `Mono#fromFuture`
* that completes: `empty`
* that errors immediately: `error`
** ...but lazily build the `Throwable`: `error(Supplier<Throwable>)`
* that never does anything: `never`
* that is decided at subscription: `defer`
* that depends on a disposable resource: `using`
* that generates events programmatically (can use state):
** synchronously and one-by-one: `Flux#generate`
** asynchronously (can also be sync), multiple emissions possible in one pass: `Flux#create`
(`Mono#create` as well, without the multiple emission aspect)

[[which.values]]
== Transforming an Existing Sequence

* I want to transform existing data:
** on a 1-to-1 basis (eg. strings to their length): `map`
*** ...by just casting it: `cast`
*** ...in order to materialize each source value's index: `Flux#index`
** on a 1-to-n basis (eg. strings to their characters): `flatMap` + use a factory method
** on a 1-to-n basis with programmatic behavior for each source element and/or state: `handle`
** running an asynchronous task for each source item (eg. urls to http request): `flatMap` + an async `Publisher`-returning method
*** ...ignoring some data: conditionally return a `Mono.empty()` in the flatMap lambda
*** ...retaining the original sequence order: `Flux#flatMapSequential` (this triggers the async processes immediately but reorders the results)
*** ...where the async task can return multiple values, from a `Mono` source: `Mono#flatMapMany`

* I want to add pre-set elements to an existing sequence:
** at the start: `Flux#startWith(T...)`
** at the end: `Flux#concatWith(T...)`

* I want to aggregate a `Flux`: (the `Flux#` prefix is assumed below)
** into a List: `collectList`, `collectSortedList`
** into a Map: `collectMap`, `collectMultiMap`
** into an arbitrary container: `collect`
** into the size of the sequence: `count`
** by applying a function between each element (eg. running sum): `reduce`
*** ...but emitting each intermediary value: `scan`
** into a boolean value from a predicate:
*** applied to all values (AND): `all`
*** applied to at least one value (OR): `any`
*** testing the presence of any value: `hasElements`
*** testing the presence of a specific value: `hasElement`


* I want to combine publishers...
** in sequential order: `Flux#concat` or `.concatWith(other)`
*** ...but delaying any error until remaining publishers have been emitted: `Flux#concatDelayError`
*** ...but eagerly subscribing to subsequent publishers: `Flux#mergeSequential`
** in emission order (combined items emitted as they come): `Flux#merge` / `.mergeWith(other)`
*** ...with different types (transforming merge): `Flux#zip` / `Flux#zipWith`
** by pairing values:
*** from 2 Monos into a `Tuple2`: `Mono#zipWith`
*** from n Monos when they all completed: `Mono#zip`
** by coordinating their termination:
*** from 1 Mono and any source into a `Mono<Void>`: `Mono#and`
*** from n sources when they all completed: `Mono#when`
*** into an arbitrary container type:
**** each time all sides have emitted: `Flux#zip` (up to the smallest cardinality)
**** each time a new value arrives at either side: `Flux#combineLatest`
** only considering the sequence that emits first: `Flux#first`, `Mono#first`, `mono.or
(otherMono).or(thirdMono)`, `flux.or(otherFlux).or(thirdFlux)`
** triggered by the elements in a source sequence: `switchMap` (each source element is mapped to a Publisher)
** triggered by the start of the next publisher in a sequence of publishers: `switchOnNext`

* I want to repeat an existing sequence: `repeat`
** ...but at time intervals: `Flux.interval(duration).flatMap(tick -> myExistingPublisher)`

* I have an empty sequence but...
** I want a value instead: `defaultIfEmpty`
** I want another sequence instead: `switchIfEmpty`

* I have a sequence but I am not interested in values: `ignoreElements`
** ...and I want the completion represented as a `Mono`: `then`
** ...and I want to wait for another task to complete at the end: `thenEmpty`
** ...and I want to switch to another `Mono` at the end: `Mono#then(mono)`
** ...and I want to emit a single value at the end: `Mono#thenReturn(T)`
** ...and I want to switch to a `Flux` at the end: `thenMany`

* I have a Mono for which I want to defer completion...
** ...until another publisher, which is derived from this value, has completed: `Mono#delayUntil(Function)`

* I want to expand elements recursively into a graph of sequences and emit the combination...
** ...expanding the graph breadth first: `expand(Function)`
** ...expanding the graph depth first: `expandDeep(Function)`

[[which.peeking]]
== Peeking into a Sequence

* Without modifying the final sequence, I want to:
** get notified of / execute additional behavior (sometimes referred to as "side-effects") on:
*** emissions: `doOnNext`
*** completion: `Flux#doOnComplete`, `Mono#doOnSuccess` (includes the result, if any)
*** error termination: `doOnError`
*** cancellation: `doOnCancel`
*** "start" of the sequence: `doFirst`
**** this is tied to `Publisher#subscribe(Subscriber)`
*** post-subscription : `doOnSubscribe`
**** as in `Subscription` acknowledgment after `subscribe`
**** this is tied to `Subscriber#onSubscribe(Subscription)`
*** request: `doOnRequest`
*** completion or error: `doOnTerminate` (Mono version includes the result, if any)
**** but *after* it has been propagated downstream: `doAfterTerminate`
*** any type of signal, represented as a `Signal`: `Flux#doOnEach`
*** any terminating condition (complete, error, cancel): `doFinally`
** log what happens internally: `log`

* I want to know of all events:
** each represented as `Signal` object:
*** in a callback outside the sequence: `doOnEach`
*** instead of the original onNext emissions: `materialize`
**** ...and get back to the onNexts: `dematerialize`
** as a line in a log: `log`

[[which.filtering]]
== Filtering a Sequence

* I want to filter a sequence:
** based on an arbitrary criteria: `filter`
*** ...that is asynchronously computed: `filterWhen`
** restricting on the type of the emitted objects: `ofType`
** by ignoring the values altogether: `ignoreElements`
** by ignoring duplicates:
*** in the whole sequence (logical set): `Flux#distinct`
*** between subsequently emitted items (deduplication): `Flux#distinctUntilChanged`

* I want to keep only a subset of the sequence:
** by taking N elements:
*** at the beginning of the sequence: `Flux#take(long)`
**** ...based on a duration: `Flux#take(Duration)`
**** ...only the first element, as a `Mono`: `Flux#next()`
**** ...using `request(N)` rather than cancellation: `Flux#limitRequest(long)`
*** at the end of the sequence: `Flux#takeLast`
*** until a criteria is met (inclusive): `Flux#takeUntil` (predicate-based), `Flux#takeUntilOther` (companion publisher-based)
*** while a criteria is met (exclusive): `Flux#takeWhile`
** by taking at most 1 element:
*** at a specific position: `Flux#elementAt`
*** at the end: `.takeLast(1)`
**** ...and emit an error if empty: `Flux#last()`
**** ...and emit a default value if empty: `Flux#last(T)`
** by skipping elements:
*** at the beginning of the sequence: `Flux#skip(long)`
**** ...based on a duration: `Flux#skip(Duration)`
*** at the end of the sequence: `Flux#skipLast`
*** until a criteria is met (inclusive): `Flux#skipUntil` (predicate-based), `Flux#skipUntilOther` (companion publisher-based)
*** while a criteria is met (exclusive): `Flux#skipWhile`
** by sampling items:
*** by duration: `Flux#sample(Duration)`
**** but keeping the first element in the sampling window instead of the last: `sampleFirst`
*** by a publisher-based window: `Flux#sample(Publisher)`
*** based on a publisher "timing out": `Flux#sampleTimeout` (each element triggers a publisher, and is emitted if that publisher does not overlap with the next)

* I expect at most 1 element (error if more than one)...
** and I want an error if the sequence is empty: `Flux#single()`
** and I want a default value if the sequence is empty: `Flux#single(T)`
** and I accept an empty sequence as well: `Flux#singleOrEmpty`



[[which.errors]]
== Handling Errors

* I want to create an erroring sequence: `error`...
** ...to replace the completion of a successful `Flux`: `.concat(Flux.error(e))`
** ...to replace the *emission* of a successful `Mono`: `.then(Mono.error(e))`
** ...if too much time elapses between onNexts: `timeout`
** ...lazily: `error(Supplier<Throwable>)`

* I want the try/catch equivalent of:
** throwing: `error`
** catching an exception:
*** and falling back to a default value: `onErrorReturn`
*** and falling back to another `Flux` or `Mono`: `onErrorResume`
*** and wrapping and re-throwing: `.onErrorMap(t -> new RuntimeException(t))`
** the finally block: `doFinally`
** the using pattern from Java 7: `using` factory method

* I want to recover from errors...
** by falling back:
*** to a value: `onErrorReturn`
*** to a `Publisher` or `Mono`, possibly different ones depending on the error: `Flux#onErrorResume` and `Mono#onErrorResume`
** by retrying: `retry`
*** ...triggered by a companion control Flux: `retryWhen`
*** ... using a standard backoff strategy (exponential backoff with jitter): `retryBackoff`

* I want to deal with backpressure "errors" (request max from upstream and apply the strategy when downstream does not produce enough request)...
** by throwing a special `IllegalStateException`: `Flux#onBackpressureError`
** by dropping excess values: `Flux#onBackpressureDrop`
*** ...except the last one seen: `Flux#onBackpressureLatest`
** by buffering excess values (bounded or unbounded): `Flux#onBackpressureBuffer`
*** ...and applying a strategy when bounded buffer also overflows: `Flux#onBackpressureBuffer` with a `BufferOverflowStrategy`

[[which.time]]
== Working with Time

* I want to associate emissions with a timing (`Tuple2<Long, T>`) measured...
** since subscription: `elapsed`
** since the dawn of time (well, computer time): `timestamp`

* I want my sequence to be interrupted if there is too much delay between emissions: `timeout`

* I want to get ticks from a clock, regular time intervals: `Flux#interval`

* I want to emit a single `0` after an initial delay: static `Mono.delay`.

* I want to introduce a delay:
** between each onNext signal: `Mono#delayElement`, `Flux#delayElements`
** before the subscription happens: `delaySubscription`

[[which.window]]
== Splitting a `Flux`

* I want to split a `Flux<T>` into a `Flux<Flux<T>>`, by a boundary criteria:
** of size: `window(int)`
*** ...with overlapping or dropping windows: `window(int, int)`
** of time `window(Duration)`
*** ...with overlapping or dropping windows: `window(Duration, Duration)`
** of size OR time (window closes when count is reached or timeout elapsed): `windowTimeout(int, Duration)`
** based on a predicate on elements: `windowUntil`
*** ...…emitting the element that triggered the boundary in the next window (`cutBefore` variant): `.windowUntil(predicate, true)`
*** ...keeping the window open while elements match a predicate: `windowWhile` (non-matching elements are not emitted)
** driven by an arbitrary boundary represented by onNexts in a control Publisher: `window(Publisher)`, `windowWhen`

* I want to split a `Flux<T>` and buffer elements within boundaries together...
** into `List`:
*** by a size boundary: `buffer(int)`
**** ...with overlapping or dropping buffers: `buffer(int, int)`
*** by a duration boundary: `buffer(Duration)`
**** ...with overlapping or dropping buffers: `buffer(Duration, Duration)`
*** by a size OR duration boundary: `bufferTimeout(int, Duration)`
*** by an arbitrary criteria boundary: `bufferUntil(Predicate)`
**** ...putting the element that triggered the boundary in the next buffer: `.bufferUntil(predicate, true)`
**** ...buffering while predicate matches and dropping the element that triggered the boundary: `bufferWhile(Predicate)`
*** driven by an arbitrary boundary represented by onNexts in a control Publisher: `buffer(Publisher)`, `bufferWhen`
** into an arbitrary "collection" type `C`: use variants like `buffer(int, Supplier<C>)`

* I want to split a `Flux<T>` so that element that share a characteristic end up in the same sub-flux: `groupBy(Function<T,K>)`
TIP: Note that this returns a `Flux<GroupedFlux<K, T>>`, each inner `GroupedFlux` shares the same `K` key accessible through `key()`.

[[which.blocking]]
== Going Back to the Synchronous World

Note: all of these methods except `Mono#toFuture` will throw an `UnsupportedOperatorException` if called from
within a `Scheduler` marked as "non-blocking only" (by default `parallel()` and `single()`).

* I have a `Flux<T>` and I want to:
** block until I can get the first element: `Flux#blockFirst`
*** ...with a timeout: `Flux#blockFirst(Duration)`
** block until I can get the last element (or null if empty): `Flux#blockLast`
*** ...with a timeout: `Flux#blockLast(Duration)`
** synchronously switch to an `Iterable<T>`: `Flux#toIterable`
** synchronously switch to a Java 8 `Stream<T>`: `Flux#toStream`

* I have a `Mono<T>` and I want:
** to block until I can get the value: `Mono#block`
*** ...with a timeout: `Mono#block(Duration)`
** a `CompletableFuture<T>`: `Mono#toFuture`

[[which.multicasting]]
== Multicasting a `Flux` to several `Subscribers`

* I want to connect multiple `Subscriber` to a `Flux`:
** and decide when to trigger the source with `connect()`: `publish()` (returns a `ConnectableFlux`)
** and trigger the source immediately (late subscribers see later data): `share()`
** and permanently connect the source when enough subscribers have registered: `.publish().autoConnect(n)`
** and automatically connect and cancel the source when subscribers go above/below the threshold: `.publish().refCount(n)`
*** ...but giving a chance for new subscribers to come in before cancelling: `.publish().refCountGrace(n, Duration)`

* I want to cache data from a `Publisher` and replay it to later subscribers:
** up to `n` elements: `cache(int)`
** caching latest elements seen within a `Duration` (Time-To-Live): `cache(Duration)`
*** ...but retain no more than `n` elements: `cache(int, Duration)`
** but without immediately triggering the source: `Flux#replay` (returns a `ConnectableFlux`)

= Flux, an Asynchronous Sequence of 0-N Items

The following image shows how a `Flux` transforms items:

A `Flux<T>` is a standard `Publisher<T>` that represents an asynchronous sequence of 0 to N
emitted items, optionally terminated by either a completion signal or an error.
As in the Reactive Streams spec, these three types of signal translate to calls to a downstream
Subscriber's `onNext`, `onComplete`, and `onError` methods.

With this large scope of possible signals, `Flux` is the general-purpose reactive type.
Note that all events, even terminating ones, are optional: no `onNext` event but an
`onComplete` event represents an _empty_ finite sequence, but remove the `onComplete` and
you have an _infinite_ empty sequence (not particularly useful, except for tests around cancellation).
Similarly, infinite sequences are not necessarily empty. For example, `Flux.interval(Duration)`
produces a `Flux<Long>` that is infinite and emits regular ticks from a clock.

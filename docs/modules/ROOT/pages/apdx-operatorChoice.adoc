[[which-operator]]
= Which operator do I need?

TIP: In this section, if an operator is specific to {javadoc}/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html[Flux] or {javadoc}/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html[Mono], it is prefixed and linked accordingly, like this: {javadoc}/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html#fromArray-T:A-[Flux#fromArray]. Common operators have no prefix, and links to both implementations are provided, for example: `just` ({javadoc}/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html#just-T%2E%2E%2E-[Flux]|link:{javadoc}/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html#just-T-[Mono]). When a specific use case is covered by a combination of operators, it is presented as a method call, with a leading dot and parameters in parentheses, as follows: `.methodCall(parameter)`.

//TODO flux:  publishOn/subscribeOn/cancelOn
//transformDeferred/transform, repeatWhen, sort, startWith
//TODO Mono.sequenceEqual

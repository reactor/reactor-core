Non-Blocking [Reactive Streams](http://reactive-streams.org) Foundation for the JVM both implementing a [Reactive Extensions]
(http://reactivex.io) inspired API and efficient event streaming support.

## Getting it
   
**3.0 requires Java 8 or + to run**.

With Gradle from repo.spring.io or Maven Central repositories (stable releases only):
```groovy
    repositories {
      //maven { url 'http://repo.spring.io/snapshot' }
      mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
      //compile "io.projectreactor:reactor-core:3.0.4.BUILD-SNAPSHOT"
      compile "io.projectreactor:reactor-core:3.0.3.RELEASE"
    }
```

## Flux

A Reactive Streams Publisher with basic flow operators.
- Static factories on Flux allow for source generation from arbitrary callbacks types.
- Instance methods allows operational building, materialized on each _Flux#subscribe()_, _Flux#subscribe()_ or multicasting operations such as _Flux#publish_ and _Flux#publishNext_.

Flux in action :
```java
Flux.fromIterable(getSomeLongList())
    .mergeWith(Flux.interval(100))
    .doOnNext(serviceA::someObserver)
    .map(d -> d * 2)
    .take(3)
    .onErrorResumeWith(errorHandler::fallback)
    .doAfterTerminate(serviceM::incrementTerminate)
    .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

## Mono
A Reactive Streams Publisher constrained to *ZERO* or *ONE* element with appropriate operators. 
- Static factories on Mono allow for deterministic *zero or one* sequence generation from arbitrary callbacks types.
- Instance methods allows operational building, materialized on each _Mono#subscribe()_ or _Mono#get()_ eventually called.

Mono in action :
```java
Mono.fromCallable(System::currentTimeMillis)
    .then(time -> Mono.first(serviceA.findRecent(time), serviceB.findRecent(time)))
    .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3), errorHandler::fallback)
    .doOnSuccess(r -> serviceM.incrementSuccess())
    .subscribe(System.out::println);
```

Blocking Mono result :
```java    
Tuple2<Long, Long> nowAndLater = 
        Mono.when(
                Mono.just(System.currentTimeMillis()),
                Flux.just(1).delay(1).map(i -> System.currentTimeMillis()))
            .block();
```

Reactor uses a [Scheduler](http://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Scheduler.html) as a
contract for arbitrary task execution. It provides some guarantees required by Reactive
Streams flows like FIFO execution.

You can use or create efficient [schedulers](http://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Schedulers.html)
to jump thread on the producing flows (subscribeOn) or receiving flows (publishOn):

```java

Mono.fromCallable( () -> System.currentTimeMillis() )
	.repeat()
    .publishOn(Schedulers.single())
    .log("foo.bar")
    .flatMap(time ->
        Mono.fromCallable(() -> { Thread.sleep(1000); return time; })
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.parallel())
    , 8) //maxConcurrency 8
    .subscribe();
```

[ParallelFlux](http://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/ParallelFlux.html) can starve your CPU's from any sequence whose work can be subdivided in concurrent
 tasks. Turn back into a `Flux` with `ParallelFlux#sequential()`, an unordered join or
 use abitrary merge strategies via 'groups()'.

```java
Mono.fromCallable( () -> System.currentTimeMillis() )
	.repeat()
    .parallel(8) //parallelism
    .runOn(Schedulers.parallel())
    .doOnNext( d -> System.out.println("I'm on thread "+Thread.currentThread()) ).
    .sequential()
    .subscribe()
```


## Hot Publishing : BlockingSink, FluxSink, MonoSink
To bridge a Subscriber or Processor into an outside context that is taking care of
producing non concurrently, use `Flux#create`, `Mono#create`, or
`FluxProcessor#connectSink()`.

```java
Flux.create(emitter -> {
         ActionListener al = e -> {
            emitter.next(textField.getText());
         };

         // without cancellation support:
         button.addActionListener(al);

         // with cancellation support:
         emitter.setCancellation(() -> {
         	button.removeListener(al);
         });
    },
    // Overflow (backpressure) handling, default is BUFFER
    FluxSink.OverflowStrategy.LATEST)
    .timeout(3)
    .doOnComplete(() -> System.out.println("completed!"))
    .subscribe(System.out::println)
```

## Hot Publishing : Processors

The 3 main processor implementations are message relays using 0 ([EmitterProcessor](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/EmitterProcessor.html)) or N threads ([TopicProcessor](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/TopicProcessor.html) and [WorkQueueProcessor](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/WorkQueueProcessor.html)). They also use bounded buffers, aka RingBuffer.

### Pub-Sub : EmitterProcessor

[A signal broadcaster](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/EmitterProcessor.html) that will safely handle asynchronous boundaries between N Subscribers (asynchronous or not) and a parent producer.

```java
EmitterProcessor<Integer> emitter = EmitterProcessor.create();
BlockingSink<Integer> sink = emitter.connectSink();
sink.next(1);
sink.next(2);
emitter.subscribe(System.out::println);
sink.next(3); //output : 3
sink.finish();
```

### Pub-Sub Replay : ReplayProcessor

Replay capacity in action:
```java
ReplayProcessor<Integer> replayer = ReplayProcessor.create();
BlockingSink<Integer> sink = replayer.connectSink();
sink.submit(1);
sink.submit(2);
replayer.subscribe(System.out::println); //output 1, 2
replayer.subscribe(System.out::println); //output 1, 2
sink.submit(3); //output : ...3 ...3
sink.finish();
```

Note : ReplayProcessor does not explicitly require a call to `connectSink()` since its demand upstream is constant and unbounded (and it will retain the specified history number of items). That means you could just call `onNext` on the processor directly without problems.

### Async Pub-Sub : TopicProcessor

[An asynchronous signal broadcaster](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/TopicProcessor.html) dedicating an event loop thread per subscriber and maxing out producing/consuming rate with temporary tolerance to latency peaks. Also supports multi-producing and emission without onSubscribe.

Also supports multi-producing and emission without onSubscribe.

```java
TopicProcessor<Integer> topic = TopicProcessor.create();
topic.subscribe(System.out::println);
topic.onNext(1); //output : ...1
topic.onNext(2); //output : ...2
topic.subscribe(System.out::println); //output : ...1, 2
topic.onNext(3); //output : ...3 ...3
topic.onComplete();
```

### Async Distributed : WorkQueueProcessor

Similar to TopicProcessor regarding thread per subscriber but this time exclusively distributing the input data signal to the next available Subscriber. [WorkQueueProcessor](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/WorkQueueProcessor.html) is also able to replay detected dropped data downstream (error or cancel) to any Subscriber ready.

queue.onNext(3); //output : ...3 
queue.onComplete();
```

## The Backpressure Thing

Most of this cool stuff uses bounded ring buffer implementation under the hood to mitigate signal processing difference between producers and consumers. Now, the operators and processors or any standard reactive stream component working on the sequence will be instructed to flow in when these buffers have free room AND only then. This means that we make sure we both have a deterministic capacity model (bounded buffer) and we never block (request more data on write capacity). Yup, it's not rocket science after all, the boring part is already being worked by us in collaboration with [Reactive Streams Commons](http://github.com/reactor/reactive-streams-commons) on going research effort.

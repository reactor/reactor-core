[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/reactor/reactor-core/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/reactor/reactor-core/latest)

Non-Blocking [Reactive Streams](http://reactive-streams.org) Foundation for the JVM both implementing a [Reactive Extensions]
(http://reactivex.io) inspired API and efficient message-passing support.

## Getting it
[![Reactor Core](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.projectreactor/reactor-core/badge.svg?style=plastic)](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.projectreactor/reactor-core)

**2.5 requires Java 8 or + to run**.

With Gradle from repo.spring.io or Maven Central repositories (stable releases only):
```groovy
    repositories {
      //maven { url 'http://repo.spring.io/snapshot' }
      mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
      //compile "io.projectreactor:reactor-core:2.5.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT"
      compile "io.projectreactor:reactor-core:2.5.0.M2"
    }
```

## Flux

A Reactive Streams Publisher with basic Rx operators.
- Static factories on Flux allow for source generation from arbitrary callbacks types.
- Instance methods allows operational building, materialized on each _Flux#subscribe()_, _Flux#consume()_ or multicasting operations such as _Flux#publish_ and _Flux#publishNext_.

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactor/projectreactor.io/master/src/main/static/assets/img/marble/flux.png" width="500">](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html)

Flux in action :
```java
Flux.fromIterable(getSomeLongList())
    .mergeWith(Flux.interval(100))
    .doOnNext(serviceA::someObserver)
    .map(d -> d * 2)
    .take(3)
    .onErrorResumeWith(errorHandler::fallback)
    .doAfterTerminate(serviceM::incrementTerminate)
    .consume(System.out::println);
```

## Mono
A Reactive Streams Publisher constrained to *ZERO* or *ONE* element with appropriate operators.
- Static factories on Mono allow for deterministic *zero or one* sequence generation from arbitrary callbacks types.
- Instance methods allows operational building, materialized on each _Mono#subscribe()_ or _Mono#get()_ eventually called.

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactor/projectreactor.io/master/src/main/static/assets/img/marble/mono.png" width="500">](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html)

Mono in action :
```java
Mono.fromCallable(System::currentTimeMillis)
    .then(time -> Mono.any(serviceA.findRecent(time), serviceB.findRecent(time)))
    .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(3), errorHandler::fallback)
    .doOnSuccess(r -> serviceM.incrementSuccess())
    .consume(System.out::println);
```

Blocking Mono result :
```java    
Tuple2<Long, Long> nowAndLater =
        Mono.when(
                Mono.just(System.currentTimeMillis()),
                Flux.just(1).delay(1).map(i -> System.currentTimeMillis()))
            .get();
```

## Schedulers

[Create and Reuse scheduling resources](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/SchedulerGroup.html) over multiple Subscribers with adapted concurrency strategy for producing flows (subscribeOn) or receiving flows (publishOn) :

```java
SchedulerGroup async = SchedulerGroup.async();
SchedulerGroup io = SchedulerGroup.io();

Flux.create( sub -> sub.onNext(System.currentTimeMillis()) )
    .publishOn(async)
    .log("foo.bar")
    .flatMap(time ->
        Mono.fromCallable(() -> { Thread.sleep(1000); return time; })
            .subscribeOn(io)
    , 8) //maxConcurrency 8
    .subscribe();

//... a little later
async.forceShutdown()
     .subscribe(Runnable::run);

io.shutdown();
```
## Hot Publishing : SignalEmitter
To bridge a Subscriber or Processor into an outside context that is taking care of producing non concurrently, use [SignalEmitter.create(Subscriber)](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/subscriber/SignalEmitter.html), the common [FluxProcessor.connectEmitter()](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/FluxProcessor.html) or Flux.yield(emitter -> {}) :

```java
Flux.yield(sink -> {
        while(sink.hasRequested()){
            Emission status = sink.emit("Non blocking and returning emission status");
            long latency = sink.submit("Blocking until emitted and returning latency");
        }
        sink.finish();
    })
    .timeout(3)
    .doOnComplete(() -> System.out.println("completed!"))
    .consume(System.out::println)

```

## Hot Publishing : Processors

The 3 main processor implementations are message relays using 0 ([EmitterProcessor](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/EmitterProcessor.html)) or N threads ([TopicProcessor](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/TopicProcessor.html) and [WorkQueueProcessor](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/WorkQueueProcessor.html)). They also use bounded and replayable buffers, aka RingBuffer.

### Pub-Sub : EmitterProcessor

[A signal broadcaster](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/EmitterProcessor.html) that will safely handle asynchronous boundaries between N Subscribers (asynchronous or not) and a parent producer.

```java
EmitterProcessor<Integer> emitter = EmitterProcessor.create();
SignalEmitter<Integer> sink = emitter.connectEmitter();
sink.submit(1);
sink.submit(2);
emitter.consume(System.out::println);
sink.submit(3); //output : 3
sink.finish();
```
Replay capacity in action:
```java
EmitterProcessor<Integer> replayer = EmitterProcessor.replay();
SignalEmitter<Integer> sink = replayer.connectEmitter();
sink.submit(1);
sink.submit(2);
replayer.consume(System.out::println); //output 1, 2
sink.submit(3); //output : 3
sink.finish();
```

### Async Pub-Sub : TopicProcessor

[An asynchronous signal broadcaster](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/TopicProcessor.html) dedicating an event loop thread per subscriber and maxing out producing/consuming rate with temporary tolerance to latency peaks. Also supports multi-producing and emission without onSubscribe.

```java
TopicProcessor<Integer> topic = TopicProcessor.create();
topic.consume(System.out::println);
topic.onNext(1); //output : ...1
topic.onNext(2); //output : ...2
topic.consume(System.out::println); //output : ...1, 2
topic.onNext(3); //output : ...3 ...3
topic.onComplete();
```

### Async Distributed : WorkQueueProcessor

Similar to TopicProcessor regarding thread per subscriber but this time exclusively distributing the input data signal to the next available Subscriber. [WorkQueueProcessor](http://projectreactor.io/core/docs/api/?reactor/core/publisher/WorkQueueProcessor.html) is also able to replay detected dropped data downstream (error or cancel) to any Subscriber ready.

```java
WorkQueueProcessor<Integer> queue = WorkQueueProcessor.create();
queue.consume(System.out::println);
queue.consume(System.out::println);
queue.onNext(1); //output : ...1
queue.onNext(2); //output : .... ...2
queue.onNext(3); //output : ...3
queue.onComplete();
```

## The Backpressure Thing

Most of this cool stuff uses bounded ring buffer implementation under the hood to mitigate signal processing difference between producers and consumers. Now, the operators and processors or any standard reactive stream component working on the sequence will be instructed to flow in when these buffers have free room AND only then. This means that we make sure we both have a deterministic capacity model (bounded buffer) and we never block (request more data on write capacity). Yup, it's not rocket science after all, the boring part is already being worked by us in collaboration with [Reactive Streams Commons](http://github.com/reactor/reactive-streams-commons) on going research effort.

## What's more in it ?

## Beyond Reactor Core
- Everything to jump outside the JVM with the non-blocking drivers from [Reactor IO](http://github.com/reactor/reactor-io).
- [Reactor Addons](http://github.com/reactor/reactor-addons) include _Bus_ and _Pipes_ event routers plus a handful of extra reactive modules.

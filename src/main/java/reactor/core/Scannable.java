/**
 * A Scannable component exposes state in a non strictly memory consistent way and

 * {@link Stream} queries from
 * {@link #actuals()}, {@link #parents()} and {@link #inners()}. This allows for
 * visiting patterns and possibly enable serviceability features.
 * <p>
 *     Scannable is also a useful tool for the advanced user eager to learn which kind

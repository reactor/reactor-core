/**
 * "Scheduling" in Reactor via
 * {@link Flux#dispatchOn dispatchOn}, {@link Mono#publishOn publishOn} or {@link FluxProcessor}.{@link FluxProcessor#async async} requires
 * {@link Consumer} of {@link Runnable}. Unlike {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} which apparently has the same
 * signature, these {@link Consumer} allow {@literal null} argument and should treat them as terminal signal to dispose
 * any used resources.
 * <p>
 * Based on this scheduling contract, a
 * {@link SchedulerGroup} offers a scheduler generator pool mutualizing one or more internal scheduler {@link Callable}
 * generator.
 *  {@link SchedulerGroup} maintains a reference count on how many scheduler have been generated. Therefore it will
 * automatically shutdown the required resources after all references have been released, e.g. when all {@link Flux}
 * using
 * {@link Flux#dispatchOn dispatchOn} have been cancelled, completed or errored. The shutdown can also be {@link SchedulerGroup#shutdown manual}
 * by setting the factories {@literal autoshutdown} to false.
 * <p>
 *   {@link SchedulerGroup} offers ready-to-use pool configurations :
 *    <ul>
 *        <li>{@link #async} : Optimized for fast {@link Runnable} executions </li>
 *        <li>{@link #io} : Optimized for slow {@link Runnable} executions </li>
 *        <li>{@link #single} : Optimized for low-latency {@link Runnable} executions </li>
 *        <li>{@link #create create} : Arbitrary group creation. </li>
 *    </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default the {@link SchedulerGroup} are not guaranteed reentrant and such support is obtained via
 * {@link SchedulerGroup#call(boolean)} or {@link FluxProcessor#async(Callable)}.

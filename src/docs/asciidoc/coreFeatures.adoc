= Reactor Core Features
The Reactor project main artifact is `reactor-core`, a reactive library that focuses on
the Reactive Streams specification and targets Java 8.

Reactor introduces composable reactive types that implement `Publisher` but also provide
a rich vocabulary of operators, most notably `Flux` and `Mono`. A `Flux` object
represents a reactive sequence of 0..N items, while a `Mono` object represents a
single-value-or-empty (0..1) result.

This distinction carries a bit of semantic information into the type, indicating the
rough cardinality of the asynchronous processing. For instance, an HTTP request produces
only one response, so there is not much sense in doing a `count` operation. Expressing
the result of such an HTTP call as a `Mono<HttpResponse>` thus makes more sense than
expressing it as a `Flux<HttpResponse>`, as it offers only operators that are relevant to
a context of zero items or one item.

Operators that change the maximum cardinality of the processing also switch to the
relevant type. For instance, the `count` operator exists in `Flux`, but it returns a
`Mono<Long>`.

[[flux]]
== `Flux`, an Asynchronous Sequence of 0-N Items

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactor/reactor-core/v3.0.7.RELEASE/src/docs/marble/flux.png[Flux]


A `Flux<T>` is a standard `Publisher<T>` representing an asynchronous sequence of 0 to N
emitted items, optionally terminated by either a completion signal or an error. Thus, the
possible values of a flux are a value, a completion signal, or an error. As in the
Reactive Streams spec, these 3 types of signal translate to calls to a downstream
object's `onNext`, `onComplete` or `onError` methods.

With this large scope of possible signals, `Flux` is the general-purpose reactive type.
Note that all events, even terminating ones, are optional: no `onNext` event but an
`onComplete` event represents an _empty_ finite sequence, but remove the `onComplete` and
you have an _infinite_ empty sequence. Similarly, infinite sequences are not necessarily
empty. For example, `Flux.interval(Duration)` produces a `Flux<Long>` that is infinite
and emits regular ticks from a clock.

[[mono]]
== `Mono`, an Asynchronous 0-1 Result
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactor/reactor-core/v3.0.7.RELEASE/src/docs/marble/mono.png[Mono]

A `Mono<T>` is a specialized `Publisher<T>` that emits at most one item and then
optionally terminates with an `onComplete` signal or an `onError` signal.

It offers only a subset of the operators that are available for a `Flux`. For instance,
combination operators can either ignore the right hand-side emissions and return another
`Mono` or emit values from both sides. In the latter case, they switch to a `Flux`.

For example, `Mono#concatWith(Publisher)` returns a `Flux` while `Mono#then(Mono)`
returns another `Mono`.

Note that a `Mono` can be used to represent no-value asynchronous processes that only
have the concept of completion (such as `Runnable`). To create one, use an empty
`Mono<Void>`.

== Simple Ways to Create a Flux or Mono and Subscribe to It
The easiest way to get started with `Flux` and `Mono` is to use one of the numerous
factory methods found in their respective classes.

For instance, to create a sequence of `String`, you can either enumerate them or put them
in a collection and create the Flux from it, as follows:

[source,java]
----
Flux<String> seq1 = Flux.just("foo", "bar", "foobar");

List<String> iterable = Arrays.asList("foo", "bar", "foobar");
Flux<String> seq2 = Flux.fromIterable(iterable);
----

Other examples of factory methods include the following:

[source,java]
----
Mono<String> noData = Mono.empty(); <1>

Mono<String> data = Mono.just("foo");

Flux<Integer> numbersFromFiveToSeven = Flux.range(5, 3); <2>
----
<1> Notice the factory method honors the generic type even though it has no value.
<2> The first parameter is the start of the range, while the second parameter is the
number of items to produce.

When it comes to subscribing, `Flux` and `Mono` make use of Java 8 lambdas. You
have a wide choice of `.subscribe()` variants that take lambdas for different
combinations of callbacks, as shown in the following method signatures:

[[subscribeMethods]]
.Lambda-based subscribe variants for `Flux`
[source,java]
----
subscribe(); <1>

subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer); <2>

subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer,
          Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer); <3>

subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer,
          Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer,
          Runnable completeConsumer); <4>

subscribe(Consumer<? super T> consumer,
          Consumer<? super Throwable> errorConsumer,
          Runnable completeConsumer,
          Consumer<? super Subscription> subscriptionConsumer); <5>
----
<1> Subscribe and trigger the sequence.
<2> Do something with each produced value.
<3> Deal with values but also react to an error.
<4> Deal with values and errors but also execute some code when the sequence successfully
completes.
<5> Deal with values and errors and successful completion but also do something with the
`Subscription` produced by this `subscribe` call.

TIP: These variants return a reference to the subscription that you can use to cancel the
subscription when no more data is needed. Upon cancellation, the source should stop
producing values and clean up any resources it created. This cancel and clean-up behavior
is represented in Reactor by the general-purpose `Disposable` interface.

include::subscribe-details.adoc[]

The Reactive Streams specification defines another variant of the `subscribe` method. It
allows the attachment of a custom Subscriber without all the other options, as shown in
the following method signature:

[source,java]
----
subscribe(Subscriber<? super T> subscriber);
----

This variant of the `subscribe` method is useful if you already have a `Subscriber`
handy. More often, though, you need it because you want to do something
subscription-related in the other callbacks. Most probably, you need to deal with
backpressure and triggering the requests yourself.

In that case, you can make things easier by using the `BaseSubscriber` abstract class,
which offers convenience methods for handling backpressure:

.Using a `BaseSubscriber` to fine tune backpressure
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> source = someStringSource();

source.map(String::toUpperCase)
      .subscribe(new BaseSubscriber<String>() { // <1>
          @Override
          protected void hookOnSubscribe(Subscription subscription) {
              // <2>
              request(1); // <3>
          }

          @Override
          protected void hookOnNext(String value) {
              request(1); // <4>
          }

          //<5>
      });
----
<1> The `BaseSubscriber` is an abstract class, so we create an anonymous implementation
and specify the generic type.
<2> `BaseSubscriber` defines hooks for the various signal handling you can implement in a
`Subscriber`. It also deals with the boilerplate of capturing the `Subscription` object
so that you can manipulate it in other hooks.
<3> `request(n)` is such a method. It propagates backpressure requests to the capture
subscription from any of the hooks. Here we start the stream by requesting one element
from the source.
<4> Upon receiving a new value, we continue requesting new items from the source one by
one.
<5> Other hooks are `hookOnComplete`, `hookOnError`, `hookOnCancel`, and `hookFinally`
(which is always called when the sequence terminates, with the type of termination passed
in as a `SignalType` parameter).

WARNING: When manipulating a request, you must be careful to produce enough demand for
the sequence to advance or your Flux will get "stuck". That is why `BaseSubscriber`
forces you to implement the subscription and `onNext` hooks, where you should usually
call `request` at least once.

`BaseSubscriber` also offers a `requestUnbounded()` method to switch to unbounded mode
(equivalent to `request(Long.MAX_VALUE)`).

[[schedulers]]
== Schedulers
Reactor, like RxJava, can be considered *concurrency agnostic*. That is, it does not
enforce a concurrency model. Rather it leaves you, the developer, in command. However,
that does not prevent the library from helping you with concurrency.

In Reactor, the execution model and where the execution happens is determined by the
`Scheduler` that is used. A
https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Scheduler.html[`Scheduler`]
is an interface that can abstract a wide range of implementations. The
https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Schedulers.html[`Schedulers`]
class has static methods that give access to the following execution contexts:

* The current thread (`Schedulers.immediate()`).
* A single, reusable thread (`Schedulers.single()`). Note that this method reuses the
same thread for all callers, until the Scheduler is disposed. If you want a per-call
dedicated thread, use `Schedulers.newSingle()` for each call.
* An elastic thread pool (`Schedulers.elastic()`). It creates new worker pools as needed,
and reuse idle ones. Worker pools that stay idle for too long (default is 60s) are
disposed. This is a good choice for I/O blocking work for instance.
`Schedulers.elastic()` is a handy way to give a blocking process its own thread, so that
it does not tie up other resources. See <<faq.wrap-blocking>>.
* a fixed pool of workers that is tuned for parallel work (`Schedulers.parallel()`). It
creates as many workers as you have CPU cores.

WARNING: While `elastic` is made to help with legacy blocking code if it cannot be avoided,
`single` and `parallel` are not. As a consequence, the use of Reactor blocking APIs
(`block()`, `blockFirst()`, `blockLast()`, `toIterable()` and `toStream()`) inside the
default single and parallel Schedulers will result in an `UnsupportedOperationException` being thrown.
 +
 +
Custom `Schedulers` can also be marked as "non blocking only" by creating instances of `Thread`
that implement the `NonBlocking` marker interface.

Additionally, you can create a `Scheduler` out of any pre-existing `ExecutorService` by
using `Schedulers.fromExecutorService(ExecutorService)`. (You can also create one from an
`Executor`, although doing so is discouraged.) You can also create new instances of the
various scheduler types by using the `newXXX` methods. For example,
`Schedulers.newElastic(yourScheduleName)` creates a new elastic scheduler named
`yourScheduleName`.

NOTE: Operators are implemented using non-blocking algorithms tuned to facilitate the
work stealing that can happen in some Schedulers.

Some operators use a specific Scheduler from `Schedulers` by default (and usually give
you the option of providing a different one). For instance, calling the factory method
`Flux.interval(Duration.ofMillis(300))` produces a `Flux<Long>` that ticks every 300ms.
By default, this is enabled by `Schedulers.parallel()`. The following line changes the
Scheduler to a new instance similar to `Schedulers.single()`:

[source,java]
Flux.interval(Duration.ofMillis(300), Schedulers.newSingle("test"))

Reactor offers two means of switching the execution context (or `Scheduler`) in a
reactive chain: `publishOn` and `subscribeOn`. Both take a `Scheduler` and let you switch
the execution context to that scheduler. But the placement of `publishOn` in the chain
matters, while the placement of `subscribeOn` does not. To understand that difference,
you first have to remember that <<reactive.subscribe,nothing happens until you
subscribe()>>.

In Reactor, when you chain operators, you can wrap as many `Flux` and `Mono`
implementations inside one another as you need. Once you subscribe, a chain of
`Subscriber` objects is created, backward (up the chain) to the first
publisher. This is effectively hidden from you. All you can see is the outer layer of
`Flux` (or `Mono`) and `Subscription`, but these intermediate operator-specific
subscribers are where the real work happens.

With that knowledge, we can have a closer look at the `publishOn` and `subscribeOn`
operators:

* `publishOn` applies in the same way as any other operator, in the middle of the
subscriber chain. It takes signals from upstream and replays them downstream while
executing the callback on a worker from the associated `Scheduler`. Consequently, it
*affects where the subsequent operators will execute* (until another `publishOn` is
chained in).
* `subscribeOn` applies to the subscription process, when that backward chain is
constructed. As a consequence, no matter where you place the `subscribeOn` in the chain,
*it always affects the context of the source emission*. However, this does not affect the
behavior of subsequent calls to `publishOn`. They still switch the execution context for
the part of the chain after them.

NOTE: Only the earliest `subscribeOn` call in the chain is actually taken into account.

include::threading.adoc[]

[[error.handling]]
== Handling Errors
TIP: For a quick look at the available operators for error handling, see
<<which.errors,the relevant operator decision tree>>.

In Reactive Streams, errors are terminal events. As soon as an error occurs, it stops the
sequence and gets propagated down the chain of operators to the last step, the
`Subscriber` you defined and its `onError` method.

Such errors should still be dealt with at the application level. For instance, you might
display an error notification in a UI or send a meaningful error payload in a REST
endpoint. For this reason, the subscriber's `onError` method should always be defined.

WARNING: If not defined, `onError` throws an `UnsupportedOperationException`. You can
further detect and triage it with the `Exceptions.isErrorCallbackNotImplemented` method.

Reactor also offers alternative means of dealing with errors in the middle of the chain,
as error-handling operators.
// TODO What does that look like? Can we get a sample?

IMPORTANT: Before you learn about error-handling operators, you must keep in mind that
*any error in a reactive sequence is a terminal event*. Even if an error-handling
operator is used, it does not allow the *original* sequence to continue. Rather, it
converts the `onError` signal into the start of a *new* sequence (the fallback one). In
other words, it replaces the terminated sequence _upstream_.

Now we can consider each means of error handling one-by-one. When relevant, we make a
parallel with imperative programming's `try` patterns.

=== Error Handling Operators
You may be familiar with several ways of dealing with exceptions in a try-catch block.
Most notably, these include the following:

. Catch and return a static default value.
. Catch and execute an alternative path with a fallback method.
. Catch and dynamically compute a fallback value.
. Catch, wrap to a `BusinessException`, and re-throw.
. Catch, log an error-specific message, and re-throw.
. Use the `finally` block to clean up resources or a Java 7 "try-with-resource" construct.

All of these have equivalents in Reactor, in the form of error-handling operators.

Before looking into these operators, we first establish a parallel between a reactive
chain and a try-catch block.

When subscribing, the `onError` callback at the end of the chain is akin to a `catch`
block. There, execution skips to the catch in case an `Exception` is thrown:
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> s = Flux.range(1, 10)
    .map(v -> doSomethingDangerous(v)) // <1>
    .map(v -> doSecondTransform(v)); // <2>
s.subscribe(value -> System.out.println("RECEIVED " + value), // <3>
            error -> System.err.println("CAUGHT " + error) // <4>
);
----
<1> A transformation is performed that can throw an exception.
<2> If everything went well, a second transformation is performed.
<3> Each successfully transformed value is printed out.
<4> In case of an error, the sequence terminates and an error message is displayed.

This is conceptually similar to the following try/catch block:
[source,java]
----
try {
    for (int i = 1; i < 11; i++) {
        String v1 = doSomethingDangerous(i); // <1>
        String v2 = doSecondTransform(v1); // <2>
        System.out.println("RECEIVED " + v2);
    }
} catch (Throwable t) {
    System.err.println("CAUGHT " + t); // <3>
}
----
<1> If an exception is thrown here...
<2> ...the rest of the loop is skipped...
<3> ...the execution goes straight to here.

Now that we have established a parallel, we'll look at the different error handling cases
and their equivalent operators.

==== Static Fallback Value
The equivalent of *(1)* (catch and return a static default value) is
`onErrorReturn`:
[source,java]
----
Flux.just(10)
    .map(this::doSomethingDangerous)
    .onErrorReturn("RECOVERED");
----

You also have the option of filtering (choosing) when to recover with a default value
versus letting the error propagate, depending on the exception that occurred:
[source,java]
----
Flux.just(10)
    .map(this::doSomethingDangerous)
    .onErrorReturn(e -> e.getMessage().equals("boom10"), "recovered10");
----

==== Fallback Method
If you want more than a single default value and you have an alternative safer way of
processing your data, you can use `onErrorResume`. This would be the equivalent of *(2)*
(catch and execute an alternative path with a fallback method).

For example, if your nominal process is fetching data from an external and unreliable
service, but you also keep a local cache of the same data that _can_ be a bit more out of
date but is more reliable, you could do the following:
[source,java]
----
Flux.just("key1", "key2")
    .flatMap(k -> callExternalService(k)) // <1>
    .onErrorResume(e -> getFromCache(k)); // <2>
----
<1> For each key, we asynchronously call the external service.
<2> If the external service call fails, we fallback to the cache for that key. Note that
we always apply the same fallback, whatever the source error, `e`, is.

Like `onErrorReturn`, `onErrorResume` has variants that let you filter which exceptions
to fallback on, based either on the exception's class or a `Predicate`. The fact that it
takes a `Function` also allows you to choose a different fallback sequence to switch to,
depending on the error encountered:
[source,java]
----
Flux.just("timeout1", "unknown", "key2")
    .flatMap(k -> callExternalService(k))
    .onErrorResume(error -> { // <1>
        if (error instanceof TimeoutException) // <2>
            return getFromCache(k);
        else if (error instanceof UnknownKeyException)  // <3>
            return registerNewEntry(k, "DEFAULT");
        else
            return Flux.error(error); // <4>
    });
----
<1> The function allows dynamically choosing how to continue.
<2> If the source times out, hit the local cache.
<3> If the source says the key is unknown, create a new entry.
<4> In all other cases, "re-throw".

==== Dynamic Fallback Value
Even if you do not have an alternative safer way of processing your data, you might want
to compute a fallback value out of the exception you received. This would be the
equivalent of *(3)* (catch and dynamically compute a fallback value).

For instance, if your return type has a variant dedicated to holding an exception (think
`Future.complete(T success)` vs `Future.completeExceptionally(Throwable error)`), you
could instantiate the error-holding variant and pass the exception.

This can be done in the same way as the fallback method solution, using `onErrorResume`.
You need a tiny bit of boilerplate:

[source,java]
----
erroringFlux.onErrorResume(error -> Mono.just( // <1>
        myWrapper.fromError(error) // <2>
));
----
<1> The boilerplate creates a `Mono` from `Mono.just` with `onErrorResume`.
<2> You then wrap the exception into the ad hoc class or otherwise compute the value out
of the exception.

==== Catch and Rethrow
In the "fallback method" example, the last line inside the `flatMap` gives us a hint as
to how item *(4)* (Catch, wrap to a `BusinessException`, and re-throw) could be achieved:

[source,java]
----
Flux.just("timeout1")
    .flatMap(k -> callExternalService(k))
    .onErrorResume(original -> Flux.error(
        new BusinessException("oops, SLA exceeded", original)
    );
----

However, there is a more straightforward way of achieving the same with `onErrorMap`:
[source,java]
----
Flux.just("timeout1")
    .flatMap(k -> callExternalService(k))
    .onErrorMap(original -> new BusinessException("oops, SLA exceeded", original));
----

==== Log or React on the Side
For cases where you want the error to continue propagating but you still want to react to
it without modifying the sequence (logging it, for instance) there is the `doOnError`
operator. This is the equivalent of *(5)* (Catch, log an error-specific message, and
re-throw). This operator, as well as all operators prefixed with `doOn` , are sometimes
referred to as a "side-effect". They let you peek inside the sequence's events without
modifying them.

The following example ensures that, when we fallback to the cache, we at least log that
the external service had a failure. We can also imagine we have statistic counters to
increment as an error side-effect.

[source,java]
----
LongAdder failureStat = new LongAdder();
Flux<String> flux =
Flux.just("unknown")
    .flatMap(k -> callExternalService(k)) // <1>
    .doOnError(e -> {
        failureStat.increment();
        log("uh oh, falling back, service failed for key " + k); // <2>
    })
    .onErrorResume(e -> getFromCache(k)); // <3>
----
<1> The external service call that can fail...
<2> ...is decorated with a logging side-effect...
<3> ...and then protected with the cache fallback.

==== Using Resources and the Finally Block
The last parallel to draw with imperative programming is the cleaning up that can be done
either via a Java 7 "try-with-resources" construct or the use of the `finally` block.
This is the equivalent of *(6)* (use the `finally` block to clean up resources or a Java
7 "try-with-resource" construct). Both have their Reactor equivalents, `using` and
`doFinally`:
[source,java]
----
AtomicBoolean isDisposed = new AtomicBoolean();
Disposable disposableInstance = new Disposable() {
    @Override
    public void dispose() {
        isDisposed.set(true); // <4>
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "DISPOSABLE";
    }
};

Flux<String> flux =
Flux.using(
        () -> disposableInstance, // <1>
        disposable -> Flux.just(disposable.toString()), // <2>
        Disposable::dispose // <3>
);
----
<1> The first lambda generates the resource. Here we return our mock `Disposable`.
<2> The second lambda processes the resource, returning a `Flux<T>`.
<3> The third lambda is called when the `Flux` from 2) terminates or is cancelled, to
clean up resources.
<4> After subscription and execution of the sequence, the `isDisposed` atomic boolean
would become `true`.

On the other hand, `doFinally` is about side-effects that you want to be executed
whenever the sequence terminates, whether with `onComplete`, `onError`, or cancellation.
It gives you a hint as to what kind of termination triggered the side-effect:

[source,java]
----
LongAdder statsCancel = new LongAdder(); // <1>

Flux<String> flux =
Flux.just("foo", "bar")
    .doFinally(type -> {
        if (type == SignalType.CANCEL) // <2>
          statsCancel.increment(); // <3>
    })
    .take(1); // <4>
----
<1> We assume we want to gather statistics. Here we use a `LongAdder`.
<2> `doFinally` consumes a `SignalType` for the type of termination.
<3> Here we increment statistics in case of cancellation only.
<4> `take(1)` will cancel after 1 item is emitted.

==== Demonstrating the Terminal Aspect of `onError`
In order to demonstrate that all these operators cause the upstream original sequence to
terminate when the error happens, we can use a more visual example with a
`Flux.interval`. The interval operator ticks every x units of time with an increasing
`Long` value:

[source,java]
----
Flux<String> flux =
Flux.interval(Duration.ofMillis(250))
    .map(input -> {
        if (input < 3) return "tick " + input;
        throw new RuntimeException("boom");
    })
    .onErrorReturn("Uh oh");

flux.subscribe(System.out::println);
Thread.sleep(2100); // <1>
----
<1> Note that `interval` executes on a *timer* `Scheduler` by default. Assuming we want
to run that example in a main class, we add a `sleep` call here so that the application
does not exit immediately without any value being produced.

This prints out one line every 250ms, as follows:
----
tick 0
tick 1
tick 2
Uh oh
----

Even with one extra second of runtime, no more tick comes in from the `interval`. The
sequence was indeed terminated by the error.

==== Retrying
There is another operator of interest with regards to error handling, and you might be
tempted to use it in the case above. `retry`, as its name indicates, lets you retry an
error-producing sequence.

The trouble is that it works by *re-subscribing* to the upstream `Flux`. This is really a
different sequence, and the original one is still terminated. To verify that, we can
re-use the previous example and append a `retry(1)` to retry once instead of using
`onErrorReturn`:

[source,java]
----
Flux.interval(Duration.ofMillis(250))
    .map(input -> {
        if (input < 3) return "tick " + input;
        throw new RuntimeException("boom");
    })
    .elapsed() // <1>
    .retry(1)
    .subscribe(System.out::println, System.err::println); // <2>

Thread.sleep(2100); // <3>
----
<1> `elapsed` associates each value with the duration since previous value was emitted.
<2> We also want to see when there is an `onError`.
<3> Ensure we have enough time for our 4x2 ticks.

This produces the following output:
----
259,tick 0
249,tick 1
251,tick 2
506,tick 0 <1>
248,tick 1
253,tick 2
java.lang.RuntimeException: boom
----
<1> A new `interval` started, from tick 0. The additional 250ms duration is
coming from the 4th tick, the one that causes the exception and subsequent
retry.

As you can see above, `retry(1)` merely re-subscribed to the original `interval`
once, restarting the tick from 0. The second time around, since the exception
still occurs, it gives up and propagates the error downstream.

There is a more advanced version of `retry` (called `retryWhen`) that uses a "companion"
`Flux` to tell whether or not a particular failure should retry. This companion `Flux` is
created by the operator but decorated by the user, in order to customize the retry
condition.

The companion `Flux` is a `Flux<Throwable>` that gets passed to a `Function`, the sole
parameter of `retryWhen`. As the user, you define that function and make it return a new
`Publisher<?>`. Retry cycles will go like this:

. Each time an error happens (potential for a retry), the error is emitted into the
companion `Flux`, which has been decorated by your function.
. If the companion `Flux` emits something, a retry happens.
. If the companion `Flux` completes, the retry cycle stops and the original sequence
*completes* too.
. If the companion `Flux` produces an error, the retry cycle stops and the original
sequence also stops *or* completes, and the error causes the original sequence to fail
and terminate.

The distinction between the previous two cases is important. Simply completing the
companion would effectively swallow an error. Consider the following way of emulating
`retry(3)` using `retryWhen`:

[source,java]
----
Flux<String> flux = Flux
    .<String>error(new IllegalArgumentException()) // <1>
    .doOnError(System.out::println) // <2>
    .retryWhen(companion -> companion.take(3)); // <3>
----
<1> This continuously produces errors, calling for retry attempts.
<2> `doOnError` *before* the retry will let us see all failures.
<3> Here, we consider the first 3 errors as retry-able (`take(3)`) and then give up.

In effect, this results in an *empty* `Flux`, but it completes *successfully*. Since
`retry(3)` on the same `Flux` would have terminated with the latest error, this
`retryWhen` example is not exactly the same as a `retry(3)`.

Getting to the same behavior involves a few additional tricks:
include::snippetRetryWhenRetry.adoc[]

TIP: Similar code can be used to implement an _exponential backoff and retry_ pattern,
as shown in the <<faq.exponentialBackoff,FAQ>>.

=== Handling Exceptions in Operators or Functions
In general, all operators can themselves contain code that potentially trigger an
exception or calls to a user-defined callback that can similarly fail, so they all
contain some form of error handling.

As a rule of thumb, an *Unchecked Exception* is always propagated through `onError`. For
instance, throwing a `RuntimeException` inside a `map` function translates to an
`onError` event, as shown in the following code:

[source,java]
----
Flux.just("foo")
    .map(s -> { throw new IllegalArgumentException(s); })
    .subscribe(v -> System.out.println("GOT VALUE"),
               e -> System.out.println("ERROR: " + e));
----

The preceding code prints out:
----
ERROR: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: foo
----

TIP: The `Exception` can be tuned before it is passed to `onError`, through the use of a
<<hooks-internal,hook>>.

Reactor, however, defines a set of exceptions (such as `OutOfMemoryError`) that are
always deemed *fatal*. See the `Exceptions.throwIfFatal` method. These errors mean that
Reactor cannot keep operating and are thrown rather than propagated.

NOTE: Internally, there are also cases where an unchecked exception still cannot be
propagated (most notably during the subscribe and request phases), due to concurrency
races that could lead to double `onError` or `onComplete` conditions. When these races
happen, the error that cannot be propagated is "dropped". These cases can still be
managed to some extent via customizable hooks, see <<hooks-dropping>>.

You may ask: "What about *Checked Exceptions*?"

If, for example, you need to call some method that declares it `throws` exceptions, you
still have to deal with those exceptions in a `try-catch` block. You have several
options, though:

1. Catch the exception and recover from it. The sequence continues normally.
2. Catch the exception and wrap it into an _unchecked_ exception, then throw it
(interrupting the sequence). The `Exceptions` utility class can help you with that (we
get to that next).
3. If you are expected to return a `Flux` (for example, you are in a `flatMap`), wrap the
exception in an error-producing `Flux`: `return Flux.error(checkedException)`. (The
sequence also terminates.)

Reactor has an `Exceptions` utility class that you can use to ensure that exceptions are
wrapped only if they are checked exceptions:

* Use the `Exceptions.propagate` method to wrap exceptions, if necessary. It also calls
`throwIfFatal` first and does not wrap `RuntimeException`.
* Use the `Exceptions.unwrap` method to get the original unwrapped exception (going back
to the root cause of a hierarchy of reactor-specific exceptions).

Consider an example of a `map` that uses a conversion method that can throw an
`IOException`:

[source,java]
----
public String convert(int i) throws IOException {
    if (i > 3) {
        throw new IOException("boom " + i);
    }
    return "OK " + i;
}
----

Now imagine that you want to use that method in a `map`. You must now explicitly catch
the exception, and your map function cannot re-throw it. So you can propagate it to the
map's `onError` method as a `RuntimeException`:

[source,java]

----
Flux<String> converted = Flux
    .range(1, 10)
    .map(i -> {
        try { return convert(i); }
        catch (IOException e) { throw Exceptions.propagate(e); }
    });
----

Later on, when subscribing to the above `Flux` and reacting to errors (such as in the
UI), you could revert back to the original exception in case you want to do something
special for IOExceptions, as shown in the following example:

[source,java]
----
converted.subscribe(
    v -> System.out.println("RECEIVED: " + v),
    e -> {
        if (Exceptions.unwrap(e) instanceof IOException) {
            System.out.println("Something bad happened with I/O");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Something bad happened");
        }
    }
);

= Testing

Whether you have written a simple chain of Reactor operators or your very own
operator, automated testing is always a good idea.

Reactor comes with a few elements dedicated to testing, gathered into their own
artifact: `reactor-test`. You can find that project
https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/tree/master/reactor-test/src[on Github]
inside of the _reactor-core_ repository.

To use it in your tests, add it as a test dependency:

.reactor-test in Maven, in `<dependencies>`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactor-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <1>
</dependency>
----
<1> If you use the <<getting,BOM>>, you do not need to specify a `<version>`...

.reactor-test in Gradle, amend the `dependencies` block
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
   testcompile 'io.projectreactor:reactor-test'
}
----

The two main uses of `reactor-test` are:

- Testing a sequence follows a given scenario, step-by-step, with
`StepVerifier`.
- Producing data in order to test behavior of operators downstream (for
example, your own operator) with `TestPublisher`.

== Testing a scenario with `StepVerifier`

The most common case for testing a Reactor sequence is to have a `Flux` or
`Mono` defined in your code (for example, returned by a method), and wanting to
test how it behaves when subscribed to.

This translates well to defining a "test scenario", where you define your
expectations in terms of events, step-by-step: what is the next expected event?
Do you expect the `Flux` to emit a particular value? Or maybe to do nothing for
the next 300ms? All of that can be expressed through the `StepVerifier` API.

For instance, you could have the following utility method in your codebase that
decorates a `Flux`:

[source,java]
----
public <T> Flux<T> appendBoomError(Flux<T> source) {
  return source.concatWith(Mono.error(new IllegalArgumentException("boom")));
}
----

So in order to test it, you want to verify the following scenario:

> I expect this `Flux` to first emit `foo`, then emit `bar`, then *produce an
error* with the message, `boom`. Subscribe and *verify* these expectations.

In the `StepVerifier` API, this translates to:

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testAppendBoomError() {
  Flux<String> source = Flux.just("foo", "bar"); // <1>

  StepVerifier.create( // <2>
    appendBoomError(source)) // <3>
    .expectNext("foo") // <4>
    .expectNext("bar")
    .expectErrorMessage("boom") // <5>
    .verify(); // <6>
}
----
<1> Since our method needs a source `Flux`, Define a simple one for
testing purposes.
<2> Create a `StepVerifier` builder that wraps and verify a `Flux`.
<3> Here we pass the `Flux` to be tested (the result of calling our utility
method)
<4> The first signal we expect to happen upon subscription is an `onNext`, with
the value `foo`.
<5> The last signal we expect to happen is a termination of the sequence with an
`onError`. The exception should have `boom` as a message.
<6> It is important to trigger the test by calling `verify()`.

The API is a builder. You start by creating a `StepVerifier` and passing the
sequence to be tested. This offers a choice of methods that allow you to:

- express _expectations_ about the next signals to occur: if any other signal
is received (or the content of the signal does not match the expectation), the
 whole test fails with a meaningful `AssertionError`. For example, you
 might use `expectNext(T...)`, `expectNextCount(long)`.
- _consume_ the next signal. This is used when you want to skip part of the
sequence OR when you want to apply a custom `assertion` on the content of the
signal (for example, check that there is an `onNext` and assert the emitted
item is a list of size 5). For example, you might use
`consumeNextWith(Consumer<T>)`.
- _miscellaneous actions_ like pausing, running arbitrary code (for example, if
you want to manipulate a test specific state or context). For example, you
might use `thenAwait(Duration)`, `then(Runnable)`.

For terminal events, the corresponding expectation methods (`expectComplete()`
and `expectError()` and all its variants) switch to an API where you cannot
express expectations anymore. In that last step, all you can do is perform some
additional configuration on the `StepVerifier` and then *trigger the
verification*, eg. with `verify()`.

What happens at this point is that the StepVerifier subscribes to the tested
`Flux` or `Mono` and plays the sequence, comparing each new signal with the
next step in the scenario. As long as these match, the test is considered a
success. As soon as there is a discrepancy, an `AssertionError` is thrown.

IMPORTANT: Remember the `verify()` step, which triggers the verification.
In order to help, the API includes a few shortcut methods that combine the
terminal expectations with a call to `verify()`: `verifyComplete()`,
`verifyError()`, `verifyErrorMessage(String)`, and others.

Note that if one of the lambda-based expectations throws an `AssertionError`, it
is reported as is, failing the test. This is useful for custom assertions.

TIP: The `verify()` method and derived shortcut methods (`verifyThenAssertThat`,
`verifyComplete()`, etc.) has no timeout by default, meaning it can block
indefinitely. You can use `StepVerifier.setDefaultTimeout(Duration)` to globally
set a timeout for these methods, or specify one on a per-call basis with
`verify(Duration)`.

== Manipulating Time

Another very interesting capability of `StepVerifier` is the way it can be used
with time-based operators in order to avoid long run times for corresponding
tests. This is done through the `StepVerifier.withVirtualTime` builder.

It looks like this:

[source,java]
----
StepVerifier.withVirtualTime(() -> Mono.delay(Duration.ofDays(1)))
//... continue expectations here
----

The way this *virtual time* feature works is that it plugs in a custom
`Scheduler` in Reactor's `Schedulers` factory. Since these timed operators
usually use the default `Schedulers.parallel()` scheduler, replacing it with a
`VirtualTimeScheduler` does the trick. However, an important pre-requisite is
that the operator be instantiated _after_ the virtual time scheduler has been
activated.

In order to increase the chances this happens correctly, the `StepVerifier`
does not take a simple `Flux` as input. `withVirtualTime` takes a `Supplier`,
which allows for lazily creating the instance of the tested flux AFTER having
done the scheduler set up.

IMPORTANT: Take extra care to ensure the `Supplier<Publisher<T>>` can be used
in a lazy fashion. Otherwise, virtual time is not guaranteed. Especially avoid
instantiating the `Flux` earlier in the test code and having the `Supplier`
return that variable. Instead, always instantiate the `Flux` inside the lambda.

There are two expectation methods that deal with time, and they are both
valid with or without virtual time:

- `thenAwait(Duration)` pauses the evaluation of steps (allowing a few signals
to occur or delays to run out)
- `expectNoEvent(Duration)` also lets the sequence play out for a given
duration, but fails the test if *any* signal occurs during that time.

Both methods pause the thread for the given duration in classic mode and
advance the virtual clock instead in virtual mode.

[[tip-expectNoEvent]]
TIP: `expectNoEvent` also considers the `subscription` as an event. If you use
it as a first step, it usually fails because the subscription signal is
detected. Use `expectSubscription().expectNoEvent(duration)` instead.

In order to quickly evaluate the behavior of our `Mono.delay` above, we can
finish writing our code like this:

[source,java]
----
StepVerifier.withVirtualTime(() -> Mono.delay(Duration.ofDays(1)))
    .expectSubscription() // <1>
    .expectNoEvent(Duration.ofDays(1)) // <2>
    .expectNext(0) // <3>
    .verifyComplete(); // <4>
----
<1> See the <<tip-expectNoEvent,tip>> above.
<2> Expect nothing to happen during a full day...
<3> ...then expect a delay that emits `0`...
<4> ...then expect completion (and trigger the verification).

We could have used `thenAwait(Duration.ofDays(1))` above, but `expectNoEvent`
has the benefit of guaranteeing that nothing happened earlier than it should
have.

Note that `verify()` returns a `Duration` value. This is the *real-time*
duration of the entire test.

WARNING: Virtual time is not a silver bullet. Keep in mind that _all_
`Schedulers` are replaced with the same `VirtualTimeScheduler`. In some cases,
you can lock the verification process because the virtual clock is not moved
forward before an expectation is expressed, resulting in the expectation
waiting on data that can only be produced by advancing time. In most cases,
you need to advance the virtual clock for sequences to emit. Virtual time also
gets very limited with infinite sequences, which might hog the thread on which
both the sequence and its verification run.

== Performing Post-execution Assertions with `StepVerifier`
After having described the final expectation of your scenario, you can switch to
a complementary assertion API instead of triggering `verify()`. To do so, use
`verifyThenAssertThat()` instead.

This method returns a `StepVerifier.Assertions` object, which you can use to
assert a few elements of state once the whole scenario has played out
successfully (since it *also calls `verify()`*). Typical (albeit advanced)
usage is to capture elements that have been dropped by some operator and assert
them (see the section on <<hooks,Hooks>>).

== Manually Emitting with `TestPublisher`
For more advanced test cases, it might be useful to have complete mastery over
the source of data, in order to trigger finely chosen signals that closely match
the particular situation you want to test.

Another situation is when you have implemented your own operator and you want to
verify how it behaves with regards to the Reactive Streams specification,
especially if its source is not well behaved.

For both cases, `reactor-test` offers the `TestPublisher` class. This is a
`Publisher<T>` that lets you programmatically trigger various signals:

- `next(T)` and `next(T, T...)` triggers 1-n `onNext` signals.
- `emit(T...)` does the same AND does `complete()`.
- `complete()` terminates with an `onComplete` signal.
- `error(Throwable)` terminates with an `onError` signal.

A well behaved `TestPublisher` can be obtained through the `create` factory
method. Also, a misbehaving `TestPublisher` can be created using the
`createNonCompliant` factory method. The latter takes a number of `Violation`
enums that define which parts of the specification the publisher can overlook.
For instance:

- `REQUEST_OVERFLOW`: Allows `next` calls to be made despite an insufficient
request, without triggering an `IllegalStateException`.
- `ALLOW_NULL`: Allows `next` calls to be made with a `null` value without
triggering a `NullPointerException`.
- `CLEANUP_ON_TERMINATE`: Allows termination signals to be sent several times
in a row. This includes `complete()`, `error()` and `emit()`.

Finally, the `TestPublisher` keeps track of internal state after subscription,
which can be asserted through its various `assert*` methods.

It can be used as a `Flux` or `Mono` by using the conversion methods `flux()`
and `mono()`.

== Checking Execution Path with `PublisherProbe`
When building complex chains of operators, you could come across cases where
there are several possible execution paths, materialized by distinct sub-sequences.

Most of the time, these sub-sequences produce a specific-enough `onNext` signal
that you can assert it was executed by looking at the end result.

For instance, consider this method that builds a chain of operators from a source
and uses a `switchIfEmpty` to fallback to a particular alternative if the source
is empty:

[source,java]
----
public Flux<String> processOrFallback(Mono<String> source, Publisher<String> fallback) {
    return source
            .flatMapMany(phrase -> Flux.fromArray(phrase.split("\\s+")))
            .switchIfEmpty(fallback);
}
----

It is easy enough to test which logical branch of the switchIfEmpty was used:
[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testSplitPathIsUsed() {
    StepVerifier.create(processOrFallback(Mono.just("just a  phrase with    tabs!"),
            Mono.just("EMPTY_PHRASE")))
                .expectNext("just", "a", "phrase", "with", "tabs!")
                .verifyComplete();
}

@Test
public void testEmptyPathIsUsed() {
    StepVerifier.create(processOrFallback(Mono.empty(), Mono.just("EMPTY_PHRASE")))
                .expectNext("EMPTY_PHRASE")
                .verifyComplete();
}
----

But think about an example where the method produces a `Mono<Void>` instead. It waits
for the source to complete, performs an additional task and completes. If the source
is empty, a fallback Runnable-like task must be performed instead:

[source,java]
----
private Mono<String> executeCommand(String command) {
    return Mono.just(command + " DONE");
}

public Mono<Void> processOrFallback(Mono<String> commandSource, Mono<Void> doWhenEmpty) {
    return commandSource
            .flatMap(command -> executeCommand(command).then()) // <1>
            .switchIfEmpty(doWhenEmpty); // <2>
}
----
<1> The `then()` forgets about the command result, just cares that it was completed
<2> How to distinguish between two cases that both are empty sequences?

In order to verify that your processOrFallback indeed goes through the `doWhenEmpty` path,
you need to write a bit of boilerplate. Namely you need a `Mono<Void>` that:

 - captures the fact that it has been subscribed to
 - lets you assert that fact **after** the whole processing has terminated...

Most straightforward way of doing that yourself involves a `Mono.empty()`, doOn*
callbacks and an `AtomicBoolean`. If you also want to assert that it was actually
requested for data, you need a second `AtomicBoolean`:

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testCommandEmptyPathIsUsedBoilerplate() {
    AtomicBoolean wasInvoked = new AtomicBoolean();
    AtomicBoolean wasRequested = new AtomicBoolean();
    Mono<Void> testFallback = Mono.<Void>empty()
                                  .doOnSubscribe(s -> wasInvoked.set(true))
                                  .doOnRequest(l -> wasRequested.set(true));

    processOrFallback(Mono.empty(), testFallback).subscribe();

    assertThat(wasInvoked.get()).isTrue();
    assertThat(wasRequested.get()).isTrue();
}
----

When you have to write a lot of tests like that, the boilerplate can become a hurdle.
Fortunately, there's an alternative with `PublisherProbe`:

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testCommandEmptyPathIsUsed() {
    PublisherProbe<Void> probe = PublisherProbe.empty(); // <1>

    StepVerifier.create(processOrFallback(Mono.empty(), probe.mono())) // <2>
                .verifyComplete();

    probe.assertWasSubscribed(); //<3>
    probe.assertWasRequested(); //<4>
    probe.assertWasNotCancelled(); //<5>
}
----
<1> Create a probe that translates to an empty sequence.
<2> Use the probe in place of the necessary `Mono<Void>` by calling `probe.mono()`
<3> After completion of the sequence, the probe lets you assert it was used. You
can check that is was subscribed to...
<4> ...as well as actually requested for data...
<5> ...but also whether or not it was cancelled.

You can also use the probe in place of a `Flux<T>` by calling `.flux()` instead of
`.mono()`. For cases where you need to probe an execution path but also need the
probe to emit data, you can wrap any `Publisher<T>` using `PublisherProbe.of(Publisher)`.

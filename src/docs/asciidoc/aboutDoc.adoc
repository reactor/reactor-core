= About the Documentation
This section provides a brief overview of Reactor reference documentation. You
do not need to read this guide in a linear fashion. Each piece stands on its
own, though they often refer to other pieces.

== Latest version & Copyright Notice
The Reactor reference guide is available as HTML documents. The latest copy is
available at http://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/docs/index.html

Copies of this document may be made for your own use and for distribution to
others, provided that you do not charge any fee for such copies and further
provided that each copy contains this Copyright Notice, whether distributed in
print or electronically.

== Contributing to the Documentation
The reference guide is written in http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[Asciidoc]
format and sources can be found at https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/tree/master/src/docs/asciidoc.

If you have an improvement, we will be happy to get a pull-request from you!

We recommend that you check out a local copy of the repository, so that you can
generate the documentation using the `asciidoctor` gradle task and check the
rendering. Some of the sections rely on included files, so GitHub rendering is
not always complete.

ifeval::["{backend}" != "html5"]
TIP: To facilitate documentation edits, most sections have a link at the end
that opens an edit UI directly on GitHub, for the main source file for that
section. These links are only present in the HTML5 version of this reference
guide.

They look like this:

== Getting help
There are several ways to reach out for help with Reactor.

* Get in touch with the community on https://gitter.im/reactor/reactor[Gitter].
* Ask a question on stackoverflow.com at http://stackoverflow.com/tags/project-reactor[`project-reactor`].
* Report bugs (or ask questions) in Github issues. The following repositories
are most closely monitored:
http://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/issues[reactor-core] (which covers the
essential features) and
http://github.com/reactor/reactor-addons/issues[reactor-addons]
(which covers reactor-test and adapters issues).

NOTE: All of Reactor is open source,
https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/tree/master/src/docs/asciidoc[including this documentation].
If you find problems with the docs or if you just want to improve them, please
https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[get involved].

== Where to go from here
* Head to <<getting-started>> if you feel like jumping straight into the code.
* If you are new to _Reactive Programming_ though, you should probably better
start with the <<intro-reactive>>.
* If you are familiar with Reactor concepts and are just looking for the right tool
for the job but cannot think of a relevant operator, try the <<which-operator>> Appendix.
* In order to dig deeper into the core features of Reactor, head to <<core-features>>:
** Learn more about Reactor's reactive types in the "<<flux>>" and "<<mono>>"
sections.
** Switch threading contexts using <<schedulers,a Scheduler>>.
** Learn how to handle errors in the <<error.handling>> section.
* Unit testing? Yes it is possible with the `reactor-test` project! See
<<testing>>.
* <<producing>> is possible for more advanced creation of reactive sources.
* More advanced topics are covered in <<advanced>>.

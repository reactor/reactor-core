== Where to go from here
 * Head to <<getting-started>> if you feel like jumping straight into the code.
 * If you're new to _Reactive Programming_ though, you'd probably better start
 with the <<intro-reactive>>...
 * In order to dig deeper into the core features of Reactor, head to <<core-features>>:
 ** If you're looking for the right tool for the job but cannot think of a
 relevant operator, maybe the <<which-operator>> section in there could help?
 ** Learn more about Reactor's reactive types in the "<<flux>>" and "<<mono>>" sections
 ** Switch threading contexts using <<schedulers,a Scheduler>>.
 ** Learn how to handle errors in the <<error.handling>> section.
 * Unit testing? Yes it is possible with the `reactor-test` project! See <<testing>>.
 * <<producing>> is possible for more advanced creation of reactive sources.

== Programmatically creating a sequence
In this section, we'll introduce means of creating a `Flux` (or `Mono`) by
programmatically defining its associated events (onNext, onError, onComplete).
All these methods share the fact that they expose an API to trigger
the events that we call a **sink**. There are actually a few sink variants, as
you will discover below.

[[producing.generate]]
=== Generate
The simplest form of programmatic creation of a `Flux` is through the `generate`
method, which takes a generator function.

This is for **synchronous** and **one-by-one** emissions, meaning that
the sink is a `SynchronousSink` and that its `next()` method can only be called
at most once per callback invocation. You can then additionally call `error(Throwable)`
or `complete()`.

The most useful variant is probably the one that also allow you to keep a state
that you can refer to in your sink usage to decide what to emit next. The generator
function then becomes a `BiFunction<S, SynchronousSink<T>, S>`, with `<S>` the
type of the state object. You have to provide a `Supplier<S>` for the initial
state, and your generator function now returns a new state on each round.

For instance, you could simply use an `int` as the state:

.Example of state-based `generate`
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> flux = Flux.generate(
    () -> 0, // <1>
    (state, sink) -> {
      sink.next("3 x " + state + " = " + 3*state); // <2>
      if (state == 10) sink.complete(); // <3>
      return state + 1; // <4>
    });
----
<1> we supply the initial state value of 0
<2> we use the state to choose what to emit (a row in the multiplication table of 3)
<3> we also use it to choose when to stop (multiplication tables traditionally stop at times ten)
<4> we return a new state that will be used in next invocation (unless the sequence terminated in this one)

The code above generates the table of 3, as the following sequence:

----
3 x 0 = 0
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30
----

You can also use a mutable `<S>`. The example above could for instance be rewritten
using a single `AtomicLong` as the state, mutating it on each round:

.Mutable state variant
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> flux = Flux.generate(
    AtomicLong::new, // <1>
    (state, sink) -> {
      long i = state.getAndIncrement(); // <2>
      sink.next("3 x " + i + " = " + 3*i);
      if (i == 10) sink.complete();
      return state; // <3>
    });
----
<1> this time we generate a mutable object as the state
<2> we mutate the state here
<3> we return the *same* instance as the new state

TIP: If your state object needs to clean up some resources, use the
`generate(Supplier<S>, BiFunction, Consumer<S>)` variant to clean up the last
state instance.

[[producing.create]]
=== Create
The more advanced form of programmatic creation of a `Flux`, `create` can both
work asynchronously or synchronously and is suitable for multiple emissions per
round.

It exposes a `FluxSink`, with its `next`/`error`/`complete` methods. Contrary
to generate, it doesn't have a state-based variant, but on the other hand it
can trigger multiple events in the callback (and even from any thread at a later
point in time).

TIP: `create` can be very useful to bridge an existing API with the reactive
world. For instance, an asynchronous API based on listeners.

Imagine that you use an API that is listener-based. It processes data by chunks
and has two events: (1) a chunk of data is ready and (2) the processing is
complete (terminal event), as represented in the `MyEventListener` interface:

[source,java]
----
interface MyEventListener<T> {
    void onDataChunk(List<T> chunk);
    void processComplete();
}
----

You can use `create` to bridge this into a `Flux<T>`:

[source,java]
----
Flux<String> bridge = Flux.create(sink -> {
    myEventProcessor.register( // <4>
      new MyEventListener<String>() { // <1>

        public void onDataChunk(List<String> chunk) {
          for(String s : chunk) {
            sink.next(s); // <2>
          }
        }

        public void processComplete() {
            sink.complete(); // <3>
        }
    });
});
----
<1> we bridge to the `MyEventListener` API
<2> each element in a chunk becomes an element in the `Flux`.
<3> the processComplete event is translated to an `onComplete`
<4> all of this is done asynchronously whenever the myEventProcessor executes

Additionally, since `create` can be asynchrounous and manages backpressure, you
can refine how to behave backpressure-wise, by indicating an `OverflowStrategy`:

 - `IGNORE` to Completely ignore downstream backpressure requests.
This may yield `IllegalStateException` when queues get full downstream.
 - `ERROR` to signal an `IllegalStateException` when the downstream can't keep up
 - `DROP` to drop the incoming signal if the downstream is not ready to receive it.
 - `LATEST` to let downstream only get the latest signals from upstream.
 - `BUFFER` (the default) to buffer all signals if the downstream can't keep up.
 (this does unbounded buffering and may lead to `OutOfMemoryError`)

NOTE: `Mono` also has a `create` generator. As you should expect, the
`MonoSink` of Mono's create doesn't allow several emissions. It will drop all
signals subsequent to the first one.


=== Handle
Both present in `Mono` and `Flux`, `handle` is a tiny bit different. It is an
instance method, meaning that it is chained on an existing source like common
operators.

It is close to `generate`, in the sense that it uses a `SynchronousSink` and
only allows one-by-one emissions.

But `handle` can be used to generate an arbitrary value out of each source
element, possibly skipping some elements. In that sense, it can serve as a
combination of `map` and `filter`.

As such, the signature of handle is `handle(BiConsumer<T, SynchronousSink<R>>)`.

Let's take an example: the reactive streams specification disallows `null`
values in a sequence. What if you want to perform a `map` but you want to use
a preexisting method as the map function, and said method sometimes returns null?

For instance, the following method:
[source,java]
----
public String alphabet(int letterNumber) {
	if (letterNumber < 1 || letterNumber > 26) {
		return null;
	}
	int letterIndexAscii = 'A' + letterNumber - 1;
	return "" + (char) letterIndexAscii;
}
----

Can be applied safely to a source of integers:
.Using `handle` for a "map and eliminate nulls" scenario
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> alphabet = Flux.just(-1, 30, 13, 9, 20)
    .handle((i, sink) -> {
        String letter = alphabet(i); // <1>
        if (letter != null) // <2>
            sink.next(letter); // <3>
    });

alphabet.subscribe(System.out::println);
----
<1> map to letters
<2> but if the "map function" returns null...
<3> ...filter it out by not calling `sink.next`

Which will print out:
----
M
I
T

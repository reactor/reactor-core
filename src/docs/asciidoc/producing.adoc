[[producing]]
= Programmatically creating a sequence
In this section, we introduce the creation of a `Flux` or a `Mono` by
programmatically defining its associated events (`onNext`, `onError`, and
`onComplete`). All these methods share the fact that they expose an API to
trigger the events that we call a *sink*. There are actually a few sink
variants, which we'll get to shortly.

[[producing.generate]]
== Synchronous `generate`
The simplest form of programmatic creation of a `Flux` is through the `generate`
method, which takes a generator function.

This is for *synchronous* and *one-by-one* emissions, meaning that
the sink is a `SynchronousSink` and that its `next()` method can only be called
at most once per callback invocation. You can then additionally call `error(Throwable)`
or `complete()`, but this is optional.

The most useful variant is probably the one that also lets you keep a state
that you can refer to in your sink usage to decide what to emit next. The generator
function then becomes a `BiFunction<S, SynchronousSink<T>, S>`, with `<S>` the
type of the state object. You have to provide a `Supplier<S>` for the initial
state, and your generator function now returns a new state on each round.

For instance, you could use an `int` as the state:

.Example of state-based `generate`
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> flux = Flux.generate(
    () -> 0, // <1>
    (state, sink) -> {
      sink.next("3 x " + state + " = " + 3*state); // <2>
      if (state == 10) sink.complete(); // <3>
      return state + 1; // <4>
    });
----
<1> We supply the initial state value of 0.
<2> We use the state to choose what to emit (a row in the multiplication table
of 3).
<3> We also use it to choose when to stop.
<4> We return a new state that we use in the next invocation (unless the
sequence terminated in this one).

The code above generates the table of 3, as the following sequence:

----
3 x 0 = 0
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30
----

You can also use a mutable `<S>`. The example above could for instance be
rewritten using a single `AtomicLong` as the state, mutating it on each round:

.Mutable state variant
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> flux = Flux.generate(
    AtomicLong::new, // <1>
    (state, sink) -> {
      long i = state.getAndIncrement(); // <2>
      sink.next("3 x " + i + " = " + 3*i);
      if (i == 10) sink.complete();
      return state; // <3>
    });
----
<1> This time, we generate a mutable object as the state.
<2> We mutate the state here.
<3> We return the *same* instance as the new state.

TIP: If your state object needs to clean up some resources, use the
`generate(Supplier<S>, BiFunction, Consumer<S>)` variant to clean up the last
state instance.

Here is an example of using the generate method that includes a `Consumer`:
[source, java]
----
Flux<String> flux = Flux.generate(
    AtomicLong::new,
      (state, sink) -> { // <1>
      long i = state.getAndIncrement(); // <2>
      sink.next("3 x " + i + " = " + 3*i);
      if (i == 10) sink.complete();
      return state; // <3>
    }, (state) -> System.out.println("state: " + state)); // <4>
}
----
<1> Again, we generate a mutable object as the state.
<2> We mutate the state here.
<3> We return the *same* instance as the new state.
<4> We see the last state value (11) as the output of this `Consumer` lambda.

In the case of the state containing a database connection or other resource
that needs to be handled at the end of the process, the `Consumer` lambda could
close the connection or  otherwise handle any tasks that should be done at the
end of the process.

[[producing.create]]
== Asynchronous & multi-threaded: `create`
`create` is a more advanced form of programmatic creation of a `Flux` which is
suitable for multiple emissions per round, even from multiple threads.

It exposes a `FluxSink`, with its `next`, `error`, and `complete` methods.
Contrary to `generate`, it doesn't have a state-based variant. On the other
hand, it can trigger multi-threaded events in the callback.

TIP: `create` can be very useful to bridge an existing API with the reactive
world - such as an asynchronous API based on listeners.

WARNING: `create` *doesn't parallelize your code nor does it make it asynchronous*, even
though it _can_ be used with asynchronous APIs. If you block within the `create` lambda,
you expose yourself to deadlocks and similar side effects. Even with the use of `subscribeOn`,
there's the caveat that a long-blocking `create` lambda (such as an infinite loop calling
`sink.next(t)`) can lock the pipeline: the requests would never be performed due to the
loop starving the same thread they are supposed to run from. Use the `subscribeOn(Scheduler, false)`
variant: `requestOnSeparateThread = false` will use the `Scheduler` thread for the `create`
and still let data flow by performing `request` in the original thread.

Imagine that you use a listener-based API. It processes data by chunks
and has two events: (1) a chunk of data is ready and (2) the processing is
complete (terminal event), as represented in the `MyEventListener` interface:

[source,java]
----
interface MyEventListener<T> {
    void onDataChunk(List<T> chunk);
    void processComplete();
}
----

You can use `create` to bridge this into a `Flux<T>`:

[source,java]
----
Flux<String> bridge = Flux.create(sink -> {
    myEventProcessor.register( // <4>
      new MyEventListener<String>() { // <1>

        public void onDataChunk(List<String> chunk) {
          for(String s : chunk) {
            sink.next(s); // <2>
          }
        }

        public void processComplete() {
            sink.complete(); // <3>
        }
    });
});
----
<1> Bridge to the `MyEventListener` API
<2> Each element in a chunk becomes an element in the `Flux`.
<3> The `processComplete` event is translated to `onComplete`.
<4> All of this is done asynchronously whenever the `myEventProcessor` executes.

Additionally, since `create` can bridge asynchronous APIs and manages backpressure, you
can refine how to behave backpressure-wise, by indicating an `OverflowStrategy`:

 - `IGNORE` to Completely ignore downstream backpressure requests.
This may yield `IllegalStateException` when queues get full downstream.
 - `ERROR` to signal an `IllegalStateException` when the downstream can't keep
 up.
 - `DROP` to drop the incoming signal if the downstream is not ready to receive
 it.
 - `LATEST` to let downstream only get the latest signals from upstream.
 - `BUFFER` (the default) to buffer all signals if the downstream can't keep up.
 (this does unbounded buffering and may lead to `OutOfMemoryError`).

NOTE: `Mono` also has a `create` generator. The `MonoSink` of Mono's create
doesn't allow several emissions. It will drop all signals after the first one.

== Asynchronous but single-threaded: `push`
`push` is a middle ground between `generate` and `create` which is suitable for
processing events from a single producer. It is similar to `create` in the sense
that it can also be asynchronous and can manage backpressure using any of the
overflow strategies supported by `create`. However, **only one producing thread**
may invoke `next`, `complete` or `error` at a time.

[source,java]
----
Flux<String> bridge = Flux.push(sink -> {
    myEventProcessor.register(
      new SingleThreadEventListener<String>() { // <1>

        public void onDataChunk(List<String> chunk) {
          for(String s : chunk) {
            sink.next(s); // <2>
          }
        }

        public void processComplete() {
            sink.complete(); // <3>
        }

        public void processError(Throwable e) {
            sink.error(e); // <4>
        }
    });
});
----
<1> Bridge to the `SingleThreadEventListener` API.
<2> Events are pushed to the sink using `next` from a single listener thread.
<3> `complete` event generated from the same listener thread.
<4> `error` event also generated from the same listener thread.

=== An hybrid push/pull model
Most Reactor operators, like `create`, follow an hybrid **push/pull** model.
What we mean by that is that despite most of the processing being asynchronous
(suggesting a _push_ approach), there is a small _pull_ component to it: the
request.

The consumer _pulls_ data from the source in the sense that it won't emit anything
until first requested. The source _pushes_ data to the consumer whenever it
becomes available, but within the bounds of its requested amount.

Note that `push()` and `create()` both allow to set up an `onRequest` consumer
in order to manage the request amount and to ensure that data is pushed through
the sink only when there is pending request.

[source,java]
----
Flux<String> bridge = Flux.create(sink -> {
    myMessageProcessor.register(
      new MyMessageListener<String>() {

        public void onMessage(List<String> messages) {
          for(String s : messages) {
            sink.next(s); // <3>
          }
        }
    });
    sink.onRequest(n -> {
        List<String> messages = myMessageProcessor.getHistory(n); // <1>
        for(String s : message) {
           sink.next(s); // <2>
        }
    });
});
----
<1> Poll for messages when requests are made.
<2> If messages are available immediately, push them to the sink.
<3> The remaining messages that arrive asynchronously later are also delivered.

=== Cleaning up after `push()` or `create()`

Two callbacks, `onDispose` and `onCancel`, perform any cleanup on cancellation
or termination. `onDispose` can be used to perform cleanup when the `Flux`
completes, errors out, or is cancelled. `onCancel` can be used to perform any
action specific to cancellation prior to cleanup with `onDispose`.

[source,java]
----
Flux<String> bridge = Flux.create(sink -> {
    sink.onRequest(n -> channel.poll(n))
        .onCancel(() -> channel.cancel()) // <1>
        .onDispose(() -> channel.close())  // <2>
    });
----
<1> `onCancel` is invoked first, for cancel signal only.
<2> `onDispose` is invoked for complete, error, or cancel signals.

== Handle
The `handle` method is a bit different: it is an instance method, meaning that
it is chained on an existing source (as are the common operators). It is present
in both `Mono` and `Flux`.

It is close to `generate`, in the sense that it uses a `SynchronousSink` and
only allows one-by-one emissions. However, `handle` can be used to generate an
arbitrary value out of each source element, possibly skipping some elements. In
this way, it can serve as a combination of `map` and `filter`. The signature of
handle is as follows:

[source,java]
----
Flux<R> handle(BiConsumer<T, SynchronousSink<R>>);
----

Let's consider an example. The reactive streams specification disallows `null`
values in a sequence. What if you want to perform a `map` but you want to use
a preexisting method as the map function, and that method sometimes returns null?

For instance, the following method can be applied safely to a source of
integers:
[source,java]
----
public String alphabet(int letterNumber) {
	if (letterNumber < 1 || letterNumber > 26) {
		return null;
	}
	int letterIndexAscii = 'A' + letterNumber - 1;
	return "" + (char) letterIndexAscii;
}
----

We can then use `handle` to remove any nulls:

.Using `handle` for a "map and eliminate nulls" scenario
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> alphabet = Flux.just(-1, 30, 13, 9, 20)
    .handle((i, sink) -> {
        String letter = alphabet(i); // <1>
        if (letter != null) // <2>
            sink.next(letter); // <3>
    });

alphabet.subscribe(System.out::println);
----
<1> Map to letters.
<2> If the "map function" returns null....
<3> Filter it out by not calling `sink.next`.

Which will print out:
----
M
I
T

== Introducing Reactor
//TODO flesh out, reword. could also be updated on the website
Reactor is a fully non-blocking reactive programming foundation for the JVM,
with efficient demand management (in the form of managing "backpressure"). It
integrates directly with the Java 8 functional APIs, notably
`CompletableFuture`, `Stream` and `Duration`. It offers composable asynchronous
sequence APIs `Flux` (for [N] elements) and `Mono` (for [0|1] elements),
extensively implementing the Reactive Extensions specification.

Reactor also supports non-blocking inter-process communication (IPC) with the
`reactor-ipc` components. Suited for Microservices Architecture, Reactor IPC
offers backpressure-ready network engines for HTTP (including Websockets), TCP
and UDP. Reactive Encoding and Decoding are fully supported.

[[prerequisites]]
== Pre-requisites
Reactor Core runs on `Java 8` and above.

It has a transitive dependency to `org.reactive-streams:reactive-streams:1.0.1`.

[NOTE]
====
*Android support*:

- Reactor 3 does not officially support or target Android (consider using
RxJava 2 if such support is a strong requirement).
- However it should work fine with Android SDK 26 (Android O) and above.
- We are open to evaluating changes that benefit Android O support in a
best-effort fashion (not guaranteed - each decision will be made on a
case-by-case basis).
====


== The BOM
Reactor 3 uses a BOM (Bill of Materials - a standard Maven artifact)
model since `reactor-core 3.0.4`, with the `Aluminium` release train.

//TODO re-state that this is a curated list of versions as opposed to generated?

The BOM lets you group artifacts that are meant to work well together without
having to wonder about the sometimes divergent versioning schemes of these
artifacts.

The BOM is a list of versioned artifacts that is itself versioned, using a
release train scheme with a codename followed by a qualifier. Here is an
example:
[verse]
Aluminium-RELEASE
Carbon-BUILD-SNAPSHOT
Aluminium-SR1
Carbon-SR32

The codenames represent what would traditionally be the MAJOR.MINOR number.
They (mostly) come from the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table#Overview[Periodic Table of Elements],
in increasing alphabetical order.

The qualifiers are (in chronological order):

 * `BUILD-SNAPSHOT`
 * `M1`..`N`: Milestones or developer previews
 * `RELEASE`: The first GA (General Availability) release in a codename series
 * `SR1`..`N`: The subsequent GA releases in a codename series (equivalent to
   PATCH number, SR stands for "Service Release").

[[getting]]
== Getting Reactor
As mentioned earlier, the easiest way to use Reactor in your core is to use
the BOM and add the relevant dependencies to your project. Note that, when
adding such a dependency, you must omit the version so that the version gets
picked up from the BOM.

However, if you want to force the use of a specific artifact's version, you can
specify it when adding your dependency, as you usually would. You can also forgo
the BOM entirely and specify dependencies by their artifact versions.

=== Maven installation
The BOM concept is natively supported by Maven. First, you need to import the
BOM by adding the following snippet to your `pom.xml`. If the top section
(`dependencyManagement`) already exists in your pom, add only the contents.

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement> <1>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
            <artifactId>reactor-bom</artifactId>
            <version>Aluminium-SR1</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----
<1> Notice the `dependencyManagement` tag. This is in addition to the regular
`dependencies` section.

Next, add your dependencies to the relevant reactor projects, as usual, except
without a `<version>`, as shown here:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
        <artifactId>reactor-core</artifactId> <1>
        <2>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.projectreactor.addons</groupId>
        <artifactId>reactor-test</artifactId> <3>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----
<1> Dependency on the core library
<2> No version tag here
<3> `reactor-test` provides facilities to unit test reactive streams

=== Gradle installation
Gradle has no core support for Maven BOMs, but you can use Spring's
https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin[gradle-dependency-management]
plugin.

First, apply the plugin from the Gradle Plugin Portal:

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id "io.spring.dependency-management" version "1.0.1.RELEASE" <1>
}
----
<1> as of this writing, 1.0.1.RELEASE is the latest version of the plugin.
Check for updates.

Then use it to import the BOM:
[source,groovy]
----
dependencyManagement {
     imports {
          mavenBom "io.projectreactor:reactor-bom:Aluminium-SR1"
     }
}
----

Finally add a dependency to your project without a version number:
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
     compile 'io.projectreactor:reactor-core' <1>
}
----
<1> There is no third `:` separated section for the version. It is taken from
the BOM.

=== Milestones and Snapshots
Milestones and developer previews are distributed through the Spring Milestones
repository rather than Maven Central. To add it to your build configuration
file, use the following snippet:

.Milestones in Maven
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>spring-milestones</id>
		<name>Spring Milestones Repository</name>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/milestone</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----

For Gradle, use the following snippet:

.Milestones in Gradle
[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
  maven { url 'http://repo.spring.io/milestone' }
  mavenCentral()
}
----

Similarly, snapshots are also available in a separate dedicated repository:

.BUILD-SNAPSHOTs in Maven
[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>spring-snapshots</id>
		<name>Spring Snapshot Repository</name>
		<url>https://repo.spring.io/snapshot</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>
----

.BUILD-SNAPSHOTs in Gradle
[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
  maven { url 'http://repo.spring.io/snapshot' }
  mavenCentral()
}
----

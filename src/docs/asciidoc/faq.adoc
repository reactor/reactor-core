[[faq.chain]]
== I just used an operator on my `Flux` but it doesn't seem to apply... What gives?

Check you have affected the result of the operator to the variable you `.subscribe()` to.

Reactor operators are decorators, they return a different instance that wraps
the source sequence and add behavior. That is why the preferred way of using
operators is to *chain* the calls.

Compare the following:

.without chaining (incorrect)
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> flux = Flux.just("foo", "chain");
flux.map(secret -> secret.replaceAll(".", "*")); <1>
flux.subscribe(next -> System.out.println("Received: " + next));
----
<1> mistake is here, the result isn't reaffected to `flux` variable

With:

.without chaining (correct)
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> flux = Flux.just("foo", "chain");
flux = flux.map(secret -> secret.replaceAll(".", "*"));
flux.subscribe(next -> System.out.println("Received: " + next));
----
And even better:

.with chaining (best)
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> secrets = Flux
  .just("foo", "chain")
  .map(secret -> secret.replaceAll(".", "*"))
  .subscribe(next -> System.out.println("Received: " + next));
----

The first version will output:

[source]
----
Received: foo
Received: chain
----

Whereas the two other versions will output the expected:

[source]
----
Received: ***
Received: *****

[[faq.monoThen]]
== My `Mono` `and` is never called

.example
[source,java]
----
myMethod.process("a") // this method returns Mono<Void>
        .and(myMethod.process("b")) //this is never called
        .subscribe();
----

If the source `Mono` is either `empty` or a `Mono<Void>` (a `Mono<Void>` is
empty for all intent and purposes), some combinations will never be called.

This is the typical case for the `and` operator, which by definition needs an element
from each source to produce its output. If any of the sources are empty, `and` produces
an empty sequence as well, so be careful of its usage eg. after a `then()`.

This is even more true of the variants of `and` that take a `Function`, meaning that
the associated Mono is chosen lazily depending on the incoming value (which never
comes in case of an empty or `Void` sequence).

You can use `.defaultIfEmpty(T)` to replace an *empty* sequence of `T` (not a `Void`
sequence) with a default value, which could help aVoid some of these situations:

.use `defaultIfEmpty` before `and`
[source,java]
----
myMethod.emptySequenceForKey("a") // this method returns empty Mono<String>
        .defaultIfEmpty("") // this converts empty sequence to just the empty String
        .and(aString -> myMethod.process("b")) //this is called with the empty String
        .subscribe();

[[faq.retryWhen]]
== How to use `retryWhen` to emulate `retry(3)`?
The `retryWhen` operator can be quite complex. Hopefully this snippet of code
can help you understand how it works by attempting to emulate a simpler
`retry(3)`:
include::snippetRetryWhenRetry.adoc[]

[[faq.exponentialBackoff]]
== How to use `retryWhen` for exponential backoff?
Exponential backoff produces retry attempts with a growing delay between each of
the attempts, so as not to overload the source systems and risk an all out
crash. The rationale is that if the source errors, it is already in an unstable
state, and not likely to immediately recover from it. So blindly retrying
immediately is likely to produce yet another error and add to the instability.

Here is how to implement an exponential backoff that delays retries and increase
the delay between each attempt (delay == attempt number * 100 milliseconds):
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> flux =
Flux.<String>error(new IllegalArgumentException())
    .retryWhen(companion -> companion
        .doOnNext(s -> System.out.println(s + " at " + LocalTime.now())) // <1>
        .zipWith(Flux.range(1, 4), (error, index) -> { // <2>
          if (index < 4) return index;
          else throw Exceptions.propagate(error);
        })
        .flatMap(index -> Mono.delay(Duration.ofMillis(index * 100))) // <3>
        .doOnNext(s -> System.out.println("retried at " + LocalTime.now())) // <4>
    );
----
<1> We log the time of errors
<2> We use the `retryWhen` + `zipWith` trick to propagate the error after 3 retries.
<3> Through `flatMap`, we cause a delay that depends on the attempt's index.
<4> We also log the time at which the retry effectively occurs.

When subscribed to, this fails and terminates after printing out:
----
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException at 18:02:29.338
retried at 18:02:29.459 <1>
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException at 18:02:29.460
retried at 18:02:29.663 <2>
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException at 18:02:29.663
retried at 18:02:29.964 <3>
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException at 18:02:29.964
----
<1> first retry after about 100ms
<2> second retry after about 200ms
<3> third retry after about 300ms

== How do I ensure thread affinity using `publishOn()`?

As described in <<schedulers, Schedulers>>, `publishOn()` can be used to switch
execution contexts. The `publishOn` operator influences the threading context
where the rest of the operators in the chain below it will execute, up to a new
occurrence of `publishOn`. So the placement of `publishOn` is significant.

For instance, in the example below, the `transform` function in `map()` is executed
on a worker of `scheduler1` and the `processNext` method in `doOnNext()` is executed
on a worker of `scheduler2`. Single threaded schedulers may be used to ensure thread affinity
for different stages in the chain or different subscribers.


[source,java]
----
EmitterProcessor<Integer> processor = EmitterProcessor.create();
processor.publishOn(scheduler1)
         .map(i -> transform(i))
         .publishOn(scheduler2)
         .doOnNext(i -> processNext(i))
         .subscribe();

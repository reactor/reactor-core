=== I just used an operator on my `Flux` but it doesn't seem to apply... What gives?

Check you have affected the result of the operator to the variable you `.subscribe()` to.

Reactor operators are decorators, they return a different instance that wraps
the source sequence and add behavior. That is why the preferred way of using
operators is to *chain* the calls.

Compare the following:

.without chaining (incorrect)
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> secrets = Flux.just("foo", "chain");
flux.map(secret -> secret.replaceAll(".", "*")); <1>
flux.subscribe(next -> System.out.println("Received: " + next));
----
<1> mistake is here

With:

.without chaining (correct)
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> secrets = Flux.just("foo", "chain");
flux = flux.map(secret -> secret.replaceAll(".", "*"));
flux.subscribe(next -> System.out.println("Received: " + next));
----
And even better:

.with chaining (best)
[source,java]
----
Flux<String> secrets = Flux
  .just("foo", "chain")
  .map(secret -> secret.replaceAll(".", "*"))
  .subscribe(next -> System.out.println("Received: " + next));
----

The first version will output:

[source]
----
Received: foo
Received: chain
----

Whereas the two other versions will output the expected:

[source]
----
Received: ***
Received: *****
----

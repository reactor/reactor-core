[[which-operator]]
== Which operator do I need?
TIP: In this section, if an operator is specific to `Flux` or `Mono` it will be
prefixed accordingly, common operators have no prefix. When a specific use case
is covered by a combination of operators, it is presented as a method call, with
leading dot and parameters in parenthesis, like `.methodCall()`.

//TODO flux: cache, share, replay, publish, publishOn/subscribeOn/cancelOn
//compose/transform, retryWhen, repeatWhen, sort, startWith
//TODO Mono.sequenceEqual

I want to deal with: <<which.create>>, <<which.values>>, <<which.peeking>>,
<<which.errors>>, <<which.time>>, <<which.window>> or <<which.blocking>>.

[[which.create]]
=== Creating a new sequence...
* that emits a `T` I already have: `just`
** ...from an `Optional<T>`: `Mono#justOrEmpty(Optional<T>)`
** ...from a potentially `null` T: `Mono#justOrEmpty(T)`
* that emits a `T` returned by a method: `just` as well
** ...but lazily captured: use `Mono#fromSupplier` or wrap `just` inside `defer`
* that emits several `T` I can explicitly enumerate: `Flux#just(T...)`
* that iterates over...
** an array: `Flux#fromArray`
** a collection / iterable: `Flux#fromIterable`
** a range of integers: `Flux#range`
* that emits from various single-valued sources like...
** a `Supplier<T>`: `Mono#fromSupplier`
** a task: `Mono#fromCallable`, `Mono#fromRunnable`
** a `CompletableFuture<T>`: `Mono#fromFuture`
* that completes: `empty`
* that errors immediately: `error`
* that never does anything: `never`
* that is decided at subscription: `defer`
* that depends on a disposable resource: `using`
* that generates events programmatically (can use state)...
** synchronously and one-by-one: `Flux#generate`
** asynchronously (can also be sync), multiple emissions possible in one pass: `Flux#create`
(`Flux#Mono` as well, without the multiple emission aspect)

[[which.values]]
=== An existing sequence
* I want to transform existing data...
** on a 1-to-1 basis (eg. strings to their length): `map`
*** ...by just casting it: `cast`
** on a 1-to-n basis (eg. strings to their characters): `flatMap` + use a factory method
** on a 1-to-n basis with programmatic behavior for each source element and/or state: `handle`
** running an asynchronous task for each source item (eg. urls to http request): `flatMap` + an async `Publisher`-returning method
*** ...ignoring some data: conditionally return a `Mono.empty()` in the flatMap lambda
*** ...retaining the original sequence order: `Flux#flatMapSequential` (this triggers the async processes immediately but reorders the results)

* I want to aggregate a `Flux`... (the `Flux#` prefix is assumed below)
** into a List: `collectList`, `collectSortedList`
** into a Map: `collectMap`, `collectMultiMap`
** into an arbitrary container: `collect`
** into the size of the sequence: `count`
** by applying a function between each element (eg. running sum): `reduce`
*** ...but emitting each intermediary value: `scan`
** into a boolean value from a predicate...
*** applied to all values (AND): `all`
*** applied to at least one value (OR): `any`
*** testing the presence of any value: `hasElements`
*** testing the presence of a specific value: `hasElement`


* I want to combine publishers...
** in sequential order: `Flux#concat` / `.concatWith(other)`
*** ...but delaying any error until remaining publishers have been emitted: `Flux#concatDelayError`
*** ...but eagerly subscribing to subsequent publishers: `Flux#mergeSequential`
** in emission order (combined items emitted as they come): `Flux#merge` / `.mergeWith(other)`
*** ...with different types (transforming merge): `Flux#zip` / `Flux#zipWith`
** by pairing values...
*** from 2 Monos into a `Tuple2`: `Mono#and`
*** from n Monos when they all completed: `Mono#when`
*** into an arbitrary container type...
**** each time all sides have emitted: `Flux#zip` (up to the smallest cardinality)
**** each time a new value arrives at either side: `Flux#combineLatest`
** only considering the sequence that emits first: `Flux#firstEmitting`, `Mono#first`, `mono.or(otherMono).or(thirdMono)`
** triggered by the elements in a source sequence: `switchMap` (each source element is mapped to a Publisher)
** triggered by the start of the next publisher in a sequence of publishers: `switchOnNext`

* I want to repeat an existing sequence: `repeat`
** ...but at time intervals: `Flux.interval(duration).flatMap(tick -> myExistingPublisher)`

* I have an empty sequence but...
** I want a value instead: `defaultIfEmpty`
** I want another sequence instead: `Flux#switchIfEmpty`, `Mono.otherwiseIfEmpty`

* I have a sequence but I'm not interested in values: `ignoreElements`
** ...and I want the completion represented as a `Mono`: `then`
** ...and I want to wait for another task to complete at the end: `thenEmpty`
** ...and I want to switch to another `Mono` at the end: `Mono#then(mono)`
** ...and I want to switch to a `Flux` at the end: `thenMany`

[[which.peeking]]
=== Peeking into a sequence
* Without modifying the final sequence, I want to...
** get notified of / execute additional behavior footnote:[sometimes referred to as "side-effects"] on...
*** emissions: `doOnNext`
*** completion: `Flux#doOnComplete`, `Mono#doOnSuccess` (includes the result if any)
*** error termination: `doOnError`
*** cancellation: `doOnCancel`
*** subscription: `doOnSubscribe`
*** request: `doOnRequest`
*** completion or error: `doOnTerminate` (Mono version includes the result if any)
**** but *after* it has been propagated downstream: `doAfterTerminate`
*** any type of signal, represented as a `Signal`: `Flux#doOnEach`
*** any terminating condition (complete, error, cancel): `doFinally`
** log what happens internally: `log`

* I want to know of all events...
** each represented as `Signal` object...
*** in a callback outside the sequence: `doOnEach`
*** instead of the original onNext emissions: `materialize`
**** ...and get back to the onNexts: `dematerialize`
** as a line in a log: `log`

[[which.filtering]]
=== Filtering a sequence
* I want to filter a sequence...
** based on an arbitrary criteria: `filter`
** restricting on the type of the emitted objects: `ofType`
** by ignoring the values altogether: `ignoreElements`
** by ignoring duplicates...
*** in the whole sequence (logical set): `Flux#distinct`
*** between subsequently emitted items (deduplication): `Flux#distinctUntilChanged`

* I want to keep only a subset of the sequence...
** by taking elements...
*** at the beginning of the sequence: `Flux#take(int)`
**** ...based on a duration: `Flux#take(Duration)`
**** ...only the first element, as a `Mono`: `Flux#next()`
*** at the end of the sequence: `Flux#takeLast`
*** until a criteria is met (inclusive): `Flux#takeUntil` (predicate-based), `Flux#takeUntilOther` (companion publisher-based)
*** while a criteria is met (exclusive): `Flux#takeWhile`
** by taking at most 1 element...
*** at a specific position: `Flux#elementAt`
*** at the end: `.takeLast(1)`
**** ...and emit an error if empty: `Flux#last()`
**** ...and emit a default value if empty: `Flux#last(T)`
** by skipping elements...
*** at the beginning of the sequence: `Flux#skip(int)`
**** ...based on a duration: `Flux#skip(Duration)`
*** at the end of the sequence: `Flux#skipLast`
*** until a criteria is met (inclusive): `Flux#skipUntil` (predicate-based), `Flux#skipUntilOther` (companion publisher-based)
*** while a criteria is met (exclusive): `Flux#skipWhile`
** by sampling items...
*** by duration: `Flux#sample(Duration)`, `Flux#sampleMillis`
**** but keeping the first element in the sampling window instead of the last: `sampleFirst`/`sampleFirstMillis`
*** by a publisher-based window: `Flux#sample(Publisher)`
*** based on a publisher "timing out": `Flux#sampleTimeout` (each element triggers a publisher, and is emitted if that publisher doesn't overlap with the next)

* I expect at most 1 element (error if more than one)...
** and I want an error if the sequence is empty: `Flux#single()`
** and I want a default value if the sequence is empty: `Flux#single(T)`
** and I accept an empty sequence as well: `Flux#singleOrEmpty`



[[which.errors]]
=== Errors
* I want to create an erroring sequence: `error`
** ...to replace the completion of a successful `Flux`: `.concat(Flux.error(e))`
** ...to replace the *emission* of a successful `Mono`: `.then(Mono.error(e))`
** ...if too much time elapses between onNexts: `timeout`

* I want the try/catch equivalent of...
** throwing: `error`
** catching an exception...
*** and falling back to a default value: `Flux#onErrorReturn`
*** and falling back to another `Flux`: `Flux#onErrorResumeWith`
*** and wrapping and re-throwing: `.onErrorResumeWith(t -> Flux.error(new RuntimeException(t)))`
** the finally block: `doFinally`
** the using pattern from Java 7: `using` factory method

* I want to recover from errors...
** by falling back: `Flux#onErrorReturn`, `Flux#onErrorResumeWith`
*** ...but from a Mono: `Mono#otherwiseReturn`, `Mono#otherwise`
** by retrying: `retry`
** by switching to another `Flux` depending on the error type: `switchOnError`

* I want to deal with backpressure "errors"footnote:[request max from upstream and apply the strategy when downstream doesn't produce enough request]...
** by throwing a special `IllegalStateException`: `Flux#onBackpressureError`
** by dropping excess values: `Flux#onBackpressureDrop`
*** ...except the last one seen: `Flux#onBackpressureLatest`
** by buffering excess values (bounded or bounded): `Flux#onBackpressureBuffer`
*** ...and applying a strategy when bounded buffer also overflows: `Flux#onBackpressureBuffer` with a `BufferOverflowStrategy`

[[which.time]]
=== Time
* I want to associate emissions with a timing (`Tuple2<Long, T>`) measured...
** since subscription: `elapsed`
** since the dawn of time (well, computer time): `timestamp`

* I want my sequence to be interrupted if there's too much delay between emissions: `timeout`

* I want to get ticks from a clock, regular time intervals: `Flux#interval`

* I want to introduce a delay...
** between each onNext signal: `delay`
** before the subscription happens: `delaySubscription`

[[which.window]]
=== Splitting a `Flux`
* I want to split a `Flux<T>` into a `Flux<Flux<T>>`, by a boundary criteria...
** of size: `window(int)`
*** ...with overlapping or dropping windows: `window(int, int)`
** of time `window(Duration)`
*** ...with overlapping or dropping windows: `window(Duration, Duration)`
** of size OR time (window closes when count is reached or timeout elapsed): `window(int, Duration)`
** based on a predicate on elements: `windowUntil`
*** ...…emitting the element that triggered the boundary in the next window (`cutBefore` variant): `.windowUntil(predicate, true)`
*** ...keeping the window open while elements match a predicate: `windowWhile` (non-matching elements are not emitted)
** driven by an arbitrary boundary represented by onNexts in a control Publisher: `window(Publisher)`

* I want to split a `Flux<T>` and buffer elements within boundaries together...
** into `List`...
*** by a size boundary: `buffer(int)`
**** ...with overlapping or dropping buffers: `buffer(int, int)`
*** by a duration boundary: `buffer(Duration)`
**** ...with overlapping or dropping buffers: `buffer(Duration, Duration)`
*** by a size OR duration boundary: `buffer(int, Duration)`
*** by an arbitrary criteria boundary: `bufferUntil(Predicate)`
**** ...putting the element that triggered the boundary in the next buffer: `.bufferUntil(predicate, true)`
**** ...buffering while predicate matches and dropping the element that triggered the boundary: `bufferWhile(Predicate)`
*** driven by an arbitrary boundary represented by onNexts in a control Publisher: `buffer(Publisher)`
** into an arbitrary "collection" type `C`: use variants like `buffer(int, Supplier<C>)`

* I want to split a `Flux<T>` so that element that share a characteristic end up in the same sub-flux: `groupBy(Function<T,K>)`
TIP: Note that this returns a `Flux<GroupedFlux<K, T>>`, each inner `GroupedFlux` shares the same `K` key accessible through `key()`.

[[which.blocking]]
=== Going back to the Synchronous world
* I have a `Flux<T>` and I want to...
** block until I can get the first element: `Flux#blockFirst`
*** ...with a timeout: `Flux#blockFirstMillis` / `Flux#blockFirst(Duration)`
** block until I can get the last element (or null if empty): `Flux#blockLast`
*** ...with a timeout: `Flux#blockLastMillis` / `Flux#blockLast(Duration)`
** synchronously switch to an `Iterable<T>`: `Flux#toIterable`
** synchronously switch to a Java 8 `Stream<T>`: `Flux#toStream`

* I have a `Mono<T>` and I want...
** to block until I can get the value: `Mono#block`
*** ...with a timeout: `Mono#blockMillis` / `Mono#block(Duration)`
** a `CompletableFuture<T>`: `Mono#toFuture`

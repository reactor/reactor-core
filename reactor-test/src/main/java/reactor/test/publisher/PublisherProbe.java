/**
 * A test utility that allow to easily obtain an instrumented {@link Publisher}
 * ({@link Mono} or {@link Flux}) for tests involving control flow. For instance, you might
 * have a {@link Mono#switchIfEmpty(Mono)}  and you want to make sure that your code
 * branched into the "if empty" case. The contract of this interface does not cover what
 * signals the {@link Publisher} emits, although factory methods {@link #of(Publisher)}
 * and {@link #empty()} produce probes that do emit signals like a common sequence.
 * <p>
 * The {@link PublisherProbe} acts as a probe capturing subscription, cancellation and
 * request events. Later, it can be used post completion to check if that particular
 * probe was hit.
 * <p>
 * Even though {@link TestPublisher} implements {@link PublisherProbe}, prefer creating
 * probes through the static {@link #empty()} and {@link #of(Publisher)} methods.
 * This is because the {@link TestPublisher} exposes assertions from {@link PublisherProbe}
 * but still requires you to 1) use the {@link TestPublisher#emit(Object[]) TestPublisher emit methods}
 * and 2) use the {@link Violation#CLEANUP_ON_TERMINATE} in order for these assertions to
 * be usable post-completion...

/**
 * A {@link StepVerifier} provides a declarative way of creating a verifiable script for
 * an async {@link Publisher} sequence, by expressing expectations about the events that
 * will happen upon subscription. The verification must be triggered after the terminal
 * expectations (completion, error, cancellation) have been declared, by calling one of
 * the {@link #verify()} methods.
 *
 *
 * <ul> <li>Create a {@code StepVerifier} around a {@link Publisher} using
 * {@link #create create(Publisher)} or
 * {@link #withVirtualTime withVirtualTime(Supplier&lt;Publisher&gt;)}
 * (in which case you should lazily create the publisher inside the provided
 * {@link Supplier lambda}).</li>
 * <li>Set up individual value expectations using
 * {@link Step#expectNext expectNext},
 * {@link Step#expectNextMatches(Predicate) expectNextMatches(Predicate)},
 * {@link Step#assertNext(Consumer) assertNext(Consumer)},
 * {@link Step#expectNextCount(long) expectNextCount(long)} or
 * {@link Step#expectNextSequence(Iterable) expectNextSequence(Iterable)}.</li>
 * <li>Trigger subscription actions during the verification using either
 * {@link Step#thenRequest(long) thenRequest(long)} or {@link Step#thenCancel() thenCancel()}. </li>
 * <li>Finalize the test scenario using a terminal expectation:
 * {@link LastStep#expectComplete expectComplete()},
 * {@link LastStep#expectError expectError()},
 * {@link LastStep#expectError(Class) expectError(Class)},
 * {@link LastStep#expectErrorMatches(Predicate) expectErrorMatches(Predicate)}, or
 * {@link LastStep#thenCancel thenCancel()}.</li>
 * <li>Trigger the verification of the resulting {@code StepVerifier} on its {@code Publisher}
 * using either {@link #verify()} or {@link #verify(Duration)}. (note some of the terminal
 * expectations above have a "verify" prefixed alternative that both declare the
 * expectation and trigger the verification).</li>
 * <li>If any expectations failed, an {@link AssertionError} will be thrown indicating the
 * failures.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For example:
 * <pre>
 * StepVerifier.create(Flux.just("foo", "bar"))
 *   .expectNext("foo")
 *   .expectNext("bar")
 *   .expectComplete()
 *   .verify();
 * </pre>

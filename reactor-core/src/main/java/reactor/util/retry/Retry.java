 * Base abstract class for a strategy to decide when to retry given a companion {@link Flux} of {@link RetrySignal},

 * Also provides access to configurable built-in strategies via static factory methods:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #indefinitely()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #max(long)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #maxInARow(long)}</li>

 * <p>
 * Users are encouraged to provide either concrete custom {@link Retry} strategies or builders that produce
 * such concrete {@link Retry}. The {@link RetrySpec} returned by e.g. {@link #max(long)} is a good inspiration
 * for a fluent approach that generates a {@link Retry} at each step and uses immutability/copy-on-write to enable
 * sharing of intermediate steps (that can thus be considered templates).

	 * will be suppressed. Its {@link Throwable} will instead be attached to a {@link RetrySignal}, immediately emitted
	 * on the {@code retrySignals} publisher. Right after that emission,
	 * {@link org.reactivestreams.Subscription#request(long) request(1)} is called on the companion publisher.
	 * <p>
	 * The response to that request decides if a retry should be made. Thus, the outer publisher will wait until a signal
	 * is emitted by the companion publisher, making it possible to delay retry attempts.

	 * Any
	 * {@link org.reactivestreams.Subscriber#onNext(Object) onNext} emitted by the companion publisher triggers a retry,

	 * {@link org.reactivestreams.Subscriber#onComplete() onComplete} will complete the outer publisher (effectively
	 * suppressing the original error/{@link Throwable}).
	 * <p>
	 * As an example, the simplest form of retry companion would be to return the incoming {@link Flux} of {@link RetrySignal}
	 * without modification. This would render a retry strategy that immediately retries, forever.

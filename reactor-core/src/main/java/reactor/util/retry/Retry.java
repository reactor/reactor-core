 * Base abstract class for a strategy to decide when to retry given a companion {@link Flux} of {@link RetrySignal},
 * for use with {@link Flux#retryWhen(Retry)} and {@link reactor.core.publisher.Mono#retryWhen(Retry)}.
 * Also provides access to configurable built-in strategies via static factory methods:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #indefinitely()}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #max(long)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link #maxInARow(long)}</li>

 * <p>
 * Users are encouraged to provide either concrete custom {@link Retry} strategies or builders that produce
 * such concrete {@link Retry}. The {@link RetrySpec} returned by eg. {@link #max(long)} is a good inspiration
 * for a fluent approach that generates a {@link Retry} at each step and uses immutability/copy-on-write to enable
 * sharing of intermediate steps (that can thus be considered templates).

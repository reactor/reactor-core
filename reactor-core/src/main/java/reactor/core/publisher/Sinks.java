 * Sinks are constructs through which Reactive Streams signals can be programmatically pushed, with {@link Flux} or {@link Mono}
 * semantics. These standalone sinks expose {@link Many#tryEmitNext(Object) tryEmit} methods that return an {@link EmitResult} enum,
 * allowing to atomically fail in case the attempted signal is inconsistent with the spec and/or the state of the sink.
 * <p>
 * This class exposes a collection of ({@link Sinks.Many} builders and {@link Sinks.One} factories. Unless constructed through the
 * {@link #unsafe()} spec, these sinks are thread safe in the sense that they will detect concurrent access and fail fast on one of
 * the attempts. {@link #unsafe()} sinks on the other hand are expected to be externally synchronized (typically by being called from
 * within a Reactive Streams-compliant context, like a {@link Subscriber} or an operator, which means it is ok to remove the overhead
 * of detecting concurrent access from the sink itself).

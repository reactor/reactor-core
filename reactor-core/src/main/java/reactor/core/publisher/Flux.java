/**
 * A Reactive Streams {@link Publisher} with rx operators that emits 0 to N elements, and then completes
 * (successfully or with an error).
 * <p>
 * The recommended way to learn about the {@link Flux} API and discover new operators is
 * through the reference documentation, rather than through this javadoc (as opposed to
 * learning more about individual operators). See the <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/docs/index.html#which-operator">
 * "which operator do I need?" appendix</a>.
 *
 * <p>
 * <img class="marble" src="doc-files/marbles/flux.svg" alt="">
 *
 * <p>It is intended to be used in implementations and return types. Input parameters should keep using raw
 * {@link Publisher} as much as possible.
 *
 * <p>If it is known that the underlying {@link Publisher} will emit 0 or 1 element, {@link Mono} should be used
 * instead.
 *
 * <p>Note that using state in the {@code java.util.function} / lambdas used within Flux operators
 * should be avoided, as these may be shared between several {@link Subscriber Subscribers}.
 *
 * <p> {@link #subscribe(CoreSubscriber)} is an internal extension to
 * {@link #subscribe(Subscriber)} used internally for {@link Context} passing. User
 * provided {@link Subscriber} may
 * be passed to this "subscribe" extension but will loose the available
 * per-subscribe {@link Hooks#onLastOperator}.
 *
 * @param <T> the element type of this Reactive Streams {@link Publisher}

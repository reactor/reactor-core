	 * An internal hook for operators to instruct this {@link SourceProducer} to terminate

	 * <p>
	 * This method is necessary for specific scenarios where a downstream consumer
	 * terminates prematurely *without* propagating a standard
	 * {@link org.reactivestreams.Subscription#cancel() cancel} signal upstream. The primary
	 * use case is for operators that short-circuit the stream, such as {@code take(0)}.
	 * <p>
	 * Without this direct termination signal, a hot source with a buffer (like a
	 * {@code Sinks.many().unicast().onBackpressureBuffer(queue)}) could be orphaned, leading to its buffered
	 * elements never being released and causing a memory leak.
	 * <p>
	 * This is not intended for public use and should only be called by Reactor framework
	 * operators. The default implementation is a no-op, allowing sources to opt in to this
	 * behavior only if they manage resources that require explicit cleanup in such scenarios.

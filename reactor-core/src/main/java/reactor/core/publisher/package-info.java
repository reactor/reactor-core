/**
 * Provide for
 * {@link reactor.core.publisher.Flux}, {@link reactor.core.publisher.Mono} composition
 * API and {@link org.reactivestreams.Processor} implementations
 *
 * <h2>Flux</h2>
 * A typed N-elements or zero sequence {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher} with core reactive extensions.
 *
 * <h2>Mono</h2>
 * A typed one-element at most sequence {@link org.reactivestreams.Publisher} with core reactive extensions.
 *
 * <h2>Processors</h2>
 * The following {@link reactor.core.publisher.FluxProcessorSink} are available, which can
 * be converted to {@link org.reactivestreams.Processor}:
 * <ul>
 *         <li>Synchronous/non-opinionated pub-sub replaying capable event emitter :
 *         {@link reactor.core.publisher.Processors#emitter()},
 *         {@link reactor.core.publisher.Processors#replay()},
 *         {@link reactor.core.publisher.Processors#unicast()} and
 *         {@link reactor.core.publisher.Processors#direct()}</li>
 *         <li>A dedicated parallel pub-sub event buffering broadcaster :
 *         {@link reactor.core.publisher.Processors#asyncEmitter()}</li>
 *         <li>A dedicated parallel work queue distribution for slow consumers :
 *         {@link reactor.core.publisher.Processors#relaxedFanOut()}</li>
 * </ul>

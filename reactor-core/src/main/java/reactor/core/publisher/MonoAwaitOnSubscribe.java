/**
 * Intercepts the onSubscribe call and makes sure calls to Subscription methods
 * only happen after the child Subscriber has returned from its onSubscribe method.
 * 
 * <p>This helps with child Subscribers that don't expect a recursive call from
 * onSubscribe into their onNext because, for example, they request immediately from
 * their onSubscribe but don't finish their preparation before that and onNext
 * runs into a half-prepared state. This can happen with non Rx mentality based Subscribers.
